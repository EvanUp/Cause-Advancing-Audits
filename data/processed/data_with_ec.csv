how bad the is the state media control in hong kong anyway?

>yet is saying anti-""migrant"" shit as of late and rightfully wants them the fuck off the streets and surrounding areas of paris

it's all bullshit like i said in my first post. ironically: it's ""fake news"". just words without actions to tame the populist right and take away more rights by pretending like macron is actually doing anything to change the situation, when in fact he's allocating a bigger portion of his budget to welcome migrants than any of the last presidents.

https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=fr&ie=utf-8&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.frontnational.com%2f2017%2f11%2fbudget-2018-immigration-et-asile-macron-fait-pire-que-le-quinquennat-de-francois-hollande%2f&edit-text=&act=url
>the ranting and other effects of the interior minister gerard collomb's sleeve will not long mask the very disturbing content of the ministerial mission on immigration, asylum and integration. indeed, the 2018 budget provides for an increase of all the budget items relating to the reception of migrants and asylum policies for an amount of 300 million euros, but an unjustifiable reduction of 7 million euros of the resources allocated to the fight against illegal immigration. while the minister of the interior announces to anyone who wants to hear him that he will reinforce the controls at the national borders and improve the devices of expulsion of the clandestine migrants, he reduces at the same time the credits allocated to the centers of administrative detention and measures of removal from the national territory.

all these bullshit comments and sound bites will do is prevent a genuine nationalist like le pen from being elected because some people are fooled that macron is addressing the situation even though he isn't, and get more people to vote for even more left-wing candidates because they think macron is ""too right-wing"" even though he's pretty much a communist.",CA,,False,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1511824853070.jpg,google,,3,843,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,3,no

i wonder if at the same time some ukrainians (maybe just the western ones, maybe not) use polish websites to. or do you have them at all? i would claim that probably 90% of all posts russians make they make on specifically russian websites. i wonder what's the percentage in poland",RU,,False,,yandex,,3,100185,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2018-04-01T00:00:00Z,26,yes

there are some weird sites behind these images (click the image and look at the website where it's hosted).

somehow google managed to evade these results but other search engines didn't care filtering it all, except for yahoo and aol that managed to show ""no results"" (even if you can see some image results when you search by ""web"" instead of ""images"").

search engines tested so far:
yandex - seems like it doesn't filter these images.
google - shows non-related images
bing - doesn't filter
yahoo - does filter (shows ""no results"" when images tab is chosen) but shows some results when web tab is chosen
aol - same as previous
baidu - shows only few related images, the rest are asian related
duckduckgo - doesn't filter

while i was making this thread i found the following site: imgsrc.ru

there are some weird sites behind these images (click the image and look at the website where it's hosted).

somehow google managed to evade these results but other search engines didn't care filtering it all, except for yahoo and aol that managed to show ""no results"" (even if you can see some image results when you search by ""web"" instead of ""images"").

search engines tested so far:
yandex - seems like it doesn't filter these images.
google - shows non-related images
bing - doesn't filter
yahoo - does filter (shows ""no results"" when images tab is chosen) but shows some results when web tab is chosen
aol - same as previous
baidu - shows only few related images, the rest are asian related
duckduckgo - doesn't filter

while i was making this thread i found the following site: imgsrc.ru

holy fuck

israeli intelligence hq, camp gilot, has been clearly visible on google maps for some time, but was obscured on yandex, the russian rival.

the rival obscured 300 sites in israel and turkey with some of them top nuclear facilities, according to a report from the federation of american scientists (fas).

now their exact locations have been revealed as the result of the gaffe because blurring them has the opposite effect by drawing attention to them.

fas intelligence analyst matt korda said: “this blurring is almost certainly the result of requests from both israel and turkey; it seems highly unlikely that a russian company would undertake such a time-consuming task of its own volition.

“fortunately, this has had the unintended effect of revealing the location and exact perimeter of every significant military facility within both countries, if one is curious enough to sift through the entire map looking for blurry patches.

the new york times on tuesday detailed how facebook, through data-sharing “business partnerships,” shared and traded user data with more than 150 companies, including amazon, microsoft, netflix, spotify, yahoo and the russian search engine yandex.

these partnerships, the oldest of which dates to 2010 and all of which were active in 2017, “effectively exempt[ed] those business partners” from facebook’s usual privacy rules, the times reported, citing hundreds of pages of internal facebook documents. 

microsoft’s bing search engine, for example, was reportedly allowed to see the names of nearly all facebook users’ friends without their consent; spotify, netflix and the royal bank of canada were able to read, write and delete users’ private messages; and amazon, microsoft and sony could obtain users’ contact information through their friends.

yahoo and yandex reportedly retained access to facebook user data even after such access was supposed to have been halted. and facebook gave apple the power to see facebook users’ contacts and calendar entries even in cases where users had disabled all data sharing. (yahoo is owned by verizon, which also is huffpost’s parent company.)

you guys have to understand the implications of this and what placement of nuclear missiles means. in the us, you have minuteman silos in minot afb, north dakota, malmstrom afb, montana, and warren afb, wyoming which are completely sequestered away from major civilian population centers. they do this because in the event of a counterforce exchange (attacking military targets with nukes) there isn't collateral damage against big cities/metropolitan areas in the hope that they can de-escalate the developments via the red phone to avoid ""counter value"" exchanges i.e. nuking st. petersburg and nyc out of revenge.

the same is the case in the uk and france. hmnb clyde and the trident subs are tucked into scottish lochs with high elevation to shield civilians from the blast waves. the french force de dissuasion has its subs placed at audierne bay where there's relatively fuck all civilians.

in israel their icbm sites are literally planted ontop of the jews right near massive civilian centers. one ballistic missile submarine hitting those jericho sites would cause a literal holocaust in terms of dead jews. this means israel does not control their nukes and the purpose of them isn't to defend israeli jews. this implies they are being held to ransom and israel doesn't have sovereignty and is controlled by some other entity. i can fucking attest that this is of note, i've not designed c3i location masking technology for the us navy, in minecraft.",GB,,False,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1543187620215.png,yandex,,3,100997,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2019-04-01T00:00:00Z,104,no

he is claiming white nationalists are white supremacists because they talk about iq, even though every white nationalist who talks about iq points out that asians have a higher average iq than whites.

i'd like him to show me even one commentator on the alt-right who would argue on camera that whites have superior iq of all races. one person. 

but he can't. because it's a shit-smelling strawman he pulled out of his ass.

many on the alt-right would be the first to explain that west africans (incl. jamaicans) are the fastest sprinters, that east africans (kenyans and ethiopians) make the best long-distance runners, that the nepalese make better guides in high-altitude settings like mt everest, etc..

by denying racial differences, tiny here is basically saying the nba is a racist organization because it hires too many black people and not enough asians. even though asians are genetically pre-disposed on average to be shorter than blacks, which puts them at a distinct disadvantage in the sport of basketball.

by the same token, he'd argue that silicon valley tech firms like apple, google, microsoft, amazon, yahoo!, etc are racist because they hire too many asians and not enough blacks, even though asians are genetically pre-disposed to being more intelligent than blacks on average.

none of this proves that duckduckgo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. these are some suggestions.

 startpage/ixquick

 these search engines are both run by the same company. startpage gets its results from google, meaning that it's google minus tracking, and ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not google. both give equivalent privacy. which one to use is a matter of preference.the company is based in the netherlands, and it has servers located in the us and the eu. it is advisable to configure it to use only eu servers in the settings. there are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. it also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable url, in order to avoid cookies. it takes privacy very seriously.

 searx

 searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to startpage and ixquick, but with less privacy features. its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. this means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. there are many other instances which provide the same features. this makes it very hard for agencies like the nsa to compromise it. even if searx is controlled by the nsa, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.

none of this proves that duckduckgo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. these are some suggestions.

 startpage/ixquick
 these search engines are both run by the same company. startpage gets its results from google, meaning that it's google minus tracking, and ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not google. both give equivalent privacy. which one to use is a matter of preference.the company is based in the netherlands, and it has servers located in the us and the eu. it is advisable to configure it to use only eu servers in the settings. there are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. it also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable url, in order to avoid cookies. it takes privacy very seriously.

 searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to startpage and ixquick, but with less privacy features. its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. this means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. there are many other instances which provide the same features. this makes it very hard for agencies like the nsa to compromise it. even if searx is controlled by the nsa, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.",GR,,False,,searx,,4,175928,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,241,yes

searx #1 for the source and instances and how easy it is to self host aka lots of instances to pick from lots of countries.

but realistically ddg is great. you can do bangs like !g to use googles indexers if you want. also you can watch yt on their end rather than yours. 
ddg also put a lot of funds towards privacy projects and the eff (which is good)
they have 1%~ market share which is pretty good right now. if decent searchers like themselves combined for 5% the internet would be a better safer place much less resistant to censorship.

brave is also really good recent controversy notwithstanding. great for aces and normies. it accomplishes 98% of what you'd get with all the security firefox plugins and other dicking around.

their recent issue was they would autocomplete crypto domains like binance with their referral id attached, but it wasn't hidden in the url or anything and theres an option to disable this.

i was looking into this theory for a while but i realized i was wrong.

kikes have thousand of years experience in sniffing out the intricate secrets of their host. sometimes masquerading as white. sometimes as arabs. (never as blacks afaik but those can be bought.)

so it came as no surprise when the biggest search engine analyser [www.searchenginewatch.com] was revealed to me as a kike puppet, that spends a lot of hours to make sure there is no technology within the search market they have missed.

if it's on the internet, they know about it, but having tentacles and periscopes inside enemy territory is useful to see what they're up to.
no need to shut down everything. just that which gets normies attention and cause them to ask questions.

the problem with right-wingers is that they fight fair. they argue knowledge and logic because they know it's right (no pun intended), instead of attacking friends and family from behind.

none of this proves that duckduckgo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. these are some suggestions.
 
 startpage/ixquick
 https://startpage.com/
 https://ixquick.com/
 
 these search engines are both run by the same company. startpage gets its results from google, meaning that it's google minus tracking, and ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not google. both give equivalent privacy. which one to use is a matter of preference.the company is based in the netherlands, and it has servers located in the us and the eu. it is advisable to configure it to use only eu servers in the settings. there are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. it also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable url, in order to avoid cookies. it takes privacy very seriously.
 
 searx
 https://searx.me/
 
 searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to startpage and ixquick, but with less privacy features. its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. this means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. there are many other instances which provide the same features. this makes it very hard for agencies like the nsa to compromise it. even if searx is controlled by the nsa, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.",AU,,False,,searx,,4,176140,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,291,yes

they're winning because they have monopoly power and we have fewer and fewer alternatives to consuming their products and thus lining our enemies' pockets.

we can still defeat them, but we must stop using youtube, facebook, cnn, twitter, google, gmai before it's too late and they hold all of the cards.

here is a list of alternatives to (((their))) revenue sources.

watch/stream/upload: utreon, bitchute, dailymotion, twitch, vevo, vimeo, gumroad, yts.mx, popcorntime, the pirate bay

email: protonmail, gmx, yandex, tutanota, mailfence

browse: firefox, opera, safari, tor browser, brave, vivaldi, torch

search: searx, swiss cows, duckduckgo, gibiru

news: newsmax, skynews, global news, project veritas, heritage foundation, hoover institute, the daily caller, the intercept, the blaze, breitbart

social: 4chan, discord, parler, mastodon, gab, mewe, rumble

other: openssh, gpg, nordvpn, mailspring, thunderbird, iterm, clementine, crypt3, aescrypt

delete chrome and install firefox. set your default search engine to duckduckgo or searx. stop using facebook, youtube, twitter. stop reading or even giving page impressions to cnn, the washington post etc...

even if it's a videogame or a movie--if it expresses identity politics, marxism, and is aimed at demoralizing westerners and rewriting our history then don't purchase it. you have torrents and other options to getting what you want without helping them. 

furthermore, make your voice heard, but do so on the platforms that support us. speaking out on twitter is exactly what they want--they want to censor you, remove you, and make a spectacle of it so you either comply and become an npc, or are displayed in a pathetic light as to help their own movement. if you use their apps, speak out, otherwise delete them completely and help rebuild an alternative world that welcomes us.",US,20.0,False,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1609733962268.png,searx,,5,176166,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,298,yes

https://www.sentinel.co/

besides the shilling of the best vpn out there.
here's my reccomendation to you faggots, get yourself a 5$ virtual server and host your own decentralized services such as invidious (youtube alternative), searx (meta search engine capable of showing duckduckgo, startpage and google (kek) ), there's also syncthing which enables you to sync file directories on any kind of devices (you dont even need a virtual server for this)

check this list out, im sure you'll find something really really cool here, moneyback guarantee if you dont find atleast one cool service here.

also sell your unused bandwith to fellow neets now by booting up a sentinel node. 

over and out, bombs away, trust the plan

accurate. it is like the time before search engines were functional, in the early 90s when the www was new. given how quickly they ban domains they don't like - see piratebay, it will soon regress to the point where you have to know the ip address of the server you want to connect to, and honestly i've been thinking of noting down server ips for a few years now.
almost every useful site is not only buried in a pile of useless shit, but disappeared from search results completely. it is their favourite action of shadowbanning - see twitter and youtube. a useful video with real information? shadowbanned so you can't search for it, and if it persists then and its channel are wiped like they never existed.
this shadoowbanning/delisting has killed good websites that were highly useful before, because all traffic has been redirected to (((chosen))) sites for a decade or more. the people running the good sites see their visitor numbers go down, and even if it is a totally free site done by volunteers or hobbyists, they shut them down because there is simply no one coming that hasn't been coming for the last 10 years, before the site was memory-holed.

oldnet you had a to make a website. it wasn't hard. it could be. i remember learning html myself in 7th grade using my dad's college text books. most hosting sites had easy builder options. this was eliminated by social media.

oldnet had forums. if you wanted to talk a out something you had to find a site with a forum for it. and they were slow. like, checking back in 2 days slow. nunet has reddit, so whatever you want to talk about has the same environment and same rules.

oldnet had p2p clients for music and movies. newnet has streaming services and spotify.

oldnet had a barrage of video websites. tons of then. some worked shitty and some just worked alright. nunet has youtube. again; all in one place, same set of rules.

oldnet had websites. web sites. there was a .com for practically everything. there was a barrage of places to go and discover. i remember being in middle school and just typing in [randomthings].com to see if there was a website named it. nunet contains domains of businesses.

oldnet had precursors to social consolidation, but there were options. yahoo. excite. lycos. each with their own email domains, chat rooms, games, articles. nunet has gmail and no more all in one, do it all here kind if sires anymore.

switching directions here, search engines finally got good. but now, deep in the nunet, if it doesn't exist on the first page of results of google, it doesn't exist. not even that, if it's not spoon fed above the results of the google search, it doesn't exist. normies thunk since they type in ""covid vax side effects,"" into google and doesn't appear in bold before all the websites telling you where to go to get the vax, it doesn't exist.

google - no entry
bing - no entry
yahoo - no entry
fucking yandex of all places - no entry

the only search engine that registers /pol/ in a search for pol is baidu - for now. so explain it. 

to disappear from search results across those platforms simultaneously? it has to be site-led. it must be the result of activity from within 4chan management, no?

and what else happens while this is going on? a new flood of shillposters, each one posting in a confident and assertive tone, as if the tenor of this place was always anti-trump, anti-russia, pro-israel, pro-deep state. the latest anti-pol plan is in operation, do you see? cut off new visitors. stuff pol with shill threads that simply assert the place is different - they're not even trying to provoke, they just want to make it look different. shut off the air supply and choke it. 

you must have noticed. the timing? the biden impeachment shit to preempt and counter the fallout from barr's investigation of the deep state's fake russiagate. 

if the deep state is headed for a showdown, this place has to be curtailed.

if you have so many programmers, why isn't there an indian version of google? at least china has baidu and russia has yandex. where is the e-commerce store? where is your search engine?

here is joe rogan, with a jew, shilling against google, and instead shilling for duckduckgo, which is also owned by a jew named gabriel weinberg. duckduckgo also contains corporatist flat art.

women had more personality, actual individual personality. and from what i've seen of modern social media addicts, women back then were way more intelligent, then again, we all were. 

we didn't have google, we didn't even have ask geeves or metacrawler, we had to commit everything to memory, and we got really good at it.

people had to converse to say anything, even if it was by a landline phone call, we had to develop interpersonal skills, and as a result, we developed finely refined personalities.

we knew how to stand up to each other. we knew how to read each other. the world was honest... as much as human nature can permit honesty. but even then, when we were being lied to, we knew. we could read each other and see through the deception.

there are good videos so long as the subject isnt political. but with that said, you can't use youtube's in-house search engine without getting a bunch of bullshit prioritized mainstream and pozzed content in your search results.
> wat doo?
use something like duckduckgo to search for the video you want
""better form archery""
then you get your search results, click ""videos"" and scroll through the listings indexed by the search engine, not youtube itself.

now because bitchute has caved to pressure from the adl, certain search terms have been hidden when you use the in-house search engine (same for jewtube of course).
> how git a'round dis?

easy.
use duckduckgo, type the follow in the search bar to use a metacrawler to find the content within a specific video hosting site that might be pozzed:
> site:bitchute.com hitler was right

just an example above.
now if you want to find specific terms, like the specific video titled ""hitler was right, use quotation marks in the field, thus:
> site:bitchute.com ""hitler was right""

cool, eh?
this is how i find a ton of great videos that still remain on you tube yet are not indexed through the in-house search engine, which would otherwise pull up gay ass, inorganic (((promoted content))) that likely has three or four interruptions by advertisements which only depict black people and *only* show whites when they are either inferior or subordinate to blacks.

so, lessons learned:
> do not use the in house search functions for jewtube or any of these sites.
> use something that isnt chrome or safari (i like brave and vivaldi :d
> dont use google to search
> use duckduckgo or something similar which doesn't rely on google for indexing results.
> search the topic you want
> click ""videos""
> voila!

for more specific searches, use the fun pseudo hacker commands ""site:"" followed by the website you would like to hunt for whatever specific terms

alternatives to google products:
google search - duckduckgo, qwant, startpage
google chrome - firefox and related browsers (i.e. palemoon, seamonkey), brave browser, comodo dragon. pic related is old but possibly useful to you, although i disagree with discounting browsers like brave and opera just because they look like they'll never become popular.
youtube - honestly this is probably the hardest to cut off for everyone, it's so ingrained into the internet at this point. sharing videos via webm is an option. you can download youtube videos into webm format using hooktube. for videos that are only on youtube (unfortunately, a lot), you can search for and watch them on duckduckgo for better privacy protection via youtube’s “youtube-nocookie” domain. in terms of serious alternatives: peertube, bitchute.
google maps - openstreetmap, maps.me
google drive - dropbox, mega

alternatives to google products:
google search - duckduckgo, qwant, startpage
google chrome - firefox and related browsers (i.e. palemoon, seamonkey), brave browser, comodo dragon. pic related is old but possibly useful to you, although i disagree with discounting browsers like brave and opera just because they look like they'll never become popular.
youtube - honestly this is probably the hardest to cut off for everyone, it's so ingrained into the internet at this point. sharing videos via webm is an option. you can download youtube videos into webm format using hooktube. for videos that are only on youtube (unfortunately, a lot), you can search for and watch them on duckduckgo for better privacy protection via youtube’s “youtube-nocookie” domain. in terms of serious alternatives: peertube, bitchute.
google maps - openstreetmap, maps.me
google drive - dropbox, mega

it’s quite impossible to be completely anonymous in the internet. but there are some tricks to make it harder to track you tho
use linux tails for an easy start, if you surf from your own computer, use tor browser 
if possible use public computers, in every library are computers 
don’t use services where you have to log in and verify and avoid all google services (at least at home)
regarding amazon, you could just avid online shopping. if you live in a larger german city you’ll get everything you need, and most shops even order stuff if you ask
if you still wanna order stuff, the deutsche post has packing stations (with deutsche post account) or postfächer (you get a number and it gets delivered to this). i don’t know if postfächer are still available anonymous but there were once

it’ll be never possible to be online and be completely anonymously, e.g. google can track you by your typing characteristics on any computer
but there are certain measures you can take to make it harder (e.g. use ecosia search instead of google, german company + privacy oriented + german and eu law) to track you

i tried so many keywords from what i remembered from the video's title. i searched pornmd, pornhub, google, all of the main tube sites. this took me an hour until i finally got a lead from a 5th page result on google. unfortunately the clip was much shorter than i hoped. but i had something to work with now.

i checked the comments and there were two anonymous users in the same predicment... they asked ""who this girl was"".

i desperately searched again. i was unsatisfied with the short clip that i had found. i tried to google every keyword term on the video.

""girlfriend morning wakeup brunette busty teen""

i tried every permutation of those keywords and nothing came up.

at this point, i have lost my erection and i'm doing it solely for the accomplishment. 

i tried to search again and again visiting pages of sketchy porn sites with the same sketchy ads. i thought i would try a different search engine.

i went to duckduckgo which surprisingly had less spammy results. i tried every keyword.

i scrolled all the way down. and out of a hunch i clicked an xvideos link ""girlfriend latina morning sex""

and surprise, it was the clip and the girl i had been looking for. i felt so happy. 

her name was conviniently tagged on the video. i went on another hour just watching what's available.

i searched for her social medias and found that she had none. (her name was nadine sage btw).

i finally decided on a clip. it was a sloppy facefuck vid. there she was, her innocent look, being completely destroyed by saliva. the idealization of this cute teen porn star was destroyed. she's just another cock loving whore after all. the orgasm i felt from cumminglasted for 10 seconds. i stated ut the window, reflecting on what i had just done.

 fully independent search engine as it has its own web crawler and index. doesn't rely on indexes from big tech. gives unbiased results and strives to protect user privacy but it is based in the uk which is a five eyes country. uses 100% green servers if that is your thing. only downside is that the results can be sometimes be weak at times.

in 2000, there were tons of separate search engines. in the late 90s, search engines had become less accurate and more corrupted by adverts and paid results, google arrived with a clean, plain format, no paid results.
once it eliminated the competition, it became more and more paid and less accurate.
about 15 years ago, google results started becoming less accurate, more interpretive. more was censored/directed.
10 years ago it was already heavily filtered, babified. searching for anything real delivered only restricted results.
8 years ago it spread to bing, with the same results more or less appearing on both.
i spent several years every now and again looking for real alternatives and found none. they were all based on yaboo/bing/google. eventually i found a version of searx that had been rebranded, then managed to find the real searx.
it was meta search, but you could choose which engines were being used, and eliminate the main - poisoned ones.
a while after that i found mojeek, which claims to be independent, designed from scratch, and the results are actually different. results however are low in number and it doesn't cover a lot of old stuff.
a lot of this filtering/diverting/censorship killed all the independent sites and forums. old visitors and user numbers dropped off, and since no one could find even heavily established sites, there were no new visitors, so they were shut down by their often one man teams.
i went to a site i'd first used 20 years before to find the guy who'd made and run it all that time saying he was closing it since his site wasn't searchable and no one was coming.
it was a really useful site and none have replaced it.

the internet might exist, but there's no way to find it. it's just the same top 10-20 sites in almost every search, and search terms aren't even searched for - it just interprets what you might be searching for from their pre-made catalogue of forced 'choices', and delivers one of those.
with no search engine, you can't really find any alternative to anything, even if it exists. there's no wide open space now, just corridors they choose for you.
one i found which was semi useful was searx, a meta search where you can turn off engines - i.e. the big ones that give false results, but it isn't up to much.

in terms of how behaviors in a network change over time we should go for the smallest and most influential communities first because that gives you the most momentum to start and i think we could get all of their networks to duplicate or switch their alternatives over 2 years. 

it's worth noting if you wanted to become an ""e-celeb"" or start something influential, you'll have a much easier chance at the moment if you're first in one of the new platforms.

startpage is a good one. it will give you results from google but it's effectively a proxy. whenever you search for images or websites, you can choose to open it with anonymous view so that you do not have to connect to the site itself to view it. instead startpage will just download the contents (except shit like javascript) and reconstruct the page.

respect is an alien concept to animals. also, predators murder their prey. also also pack hunters die all the time attempting to take down dangerous prey... they utilize every unfair advantage in their arsenal to dogpile on the weakest and most vulnerable. also also also predators are the attackers, no animal in nature will subdue an assailant and not kill the fuck out of it.

self defense isn't about dispensing justice. it's survial. you should not go around stabbing people, that isn't justice either.

ok so while i won't explain each of these methods in detail, i'll list the method of protection along with what it does:

a network level vpn (router level) - runs all network traffic through a vpn meaning that you can't be identified by ip address, important against being identified by the police more than anything. (socks5 aswell as this is good)
>nordvpn and proton are pozed. same ceo for both companies and somehting about payments going to luthiania
>take the sentinel pill, blockchain based vpn
http://www.sentinel.co

if you got spare pc or laptop. isolate your shitposting ""computer or connection"" from your main computer - nothing done on one computer can be linked to anything done on the other computer.

secure your computer systems use custom firewalls and security solutions to ensure that the regular malware infested tools that you'll find won't work.

use fde or full disk encryption - to stop forensic teams from being able to inspect your computers and link activities to you.

harden your chosen operating system settings and security - (you'll have to (((google))) or quant/swisscows.ch/yandex(if you're fine with fsb) how to harden your specific operating system). stop using mac and windows or any google products. 
>take the linux pill
>alt mobile os like ubuntu touch and lineageos

use a proxy within the browser - always (this is to give the impression of you being an average user and to make sure that even if the vpn fails you can't log into any shady sites without some level of protection.

harden your browser - to reduce the attack vectors that hackers, skids and law enforcement would use to identify you.

here are some arguments:
your first source of 'evidence':
1. link to a tweet of tom scott, one which has been followed up by the brave team and fixed. the project is new and you can't do everything right in one go, but they fix critique and that is just so conveniently not included. pic related. this is over 2 years ago.

2. the other argument is about how you need to kyc to withdraw your bat, which is due to law restrictions. opting into the bat rewards program is completely your own choice - you don't have to - so this is a complete non-argument.

your second source of 'evidence': 
1. they identify auto-updates as evidence that it's spyware... completely lacking any foundation whatsoever. in fact, forcing auto-updates on your users might prevent them from never updating and running into security risks.

2. ""google is default"" - you get the option to choose during setup. besides, brave is working on their own privacy-aimed search engine called ""brave search"" which will from that point on out become the default selected.

3. telemetry setting is unchecked during setup and transparantly asked for.

4. the rest is just a bunch of nonsense about requests the browser makes without showing any sensitive data in payloads etc.

i have outlined a project that can be made very easily and cheaply by 1 software engineer who knows how to write browser plugins. 
at the very least, since nobody really cares at google, someone can create a plugin / filter for google search results, that will remove some common garbage from g search results. that can be customizable for each user.

this can be easily converted for other search engines, such as duckduckgo and bing. not sure about yandex, but last time i checked russians are pretty good at allowing various filters. 

see these posts: 
the next step would be getting a computer with a bunch of storage or a server , in a hosting or even at home, and an open source software that can run your own search engine. possibly look at elastic search (not open source , as a concept), majestic , etc. storage and hosting is so cheap that you really don't need any finances to start.

2. now, we need to store some user data, sql is good, postgres is good and free, here, dont forget balance and shit.
3. next step - we need aggregations and lots of text filtering, data looks like a mess, so nosql, text, aggs - it is elasticsearch time! wait, legal called, its opensearch, bugger.

i could of not cared less. i am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. in an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. we often put our false mortality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-madonnas, but you seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. so i ask you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. in your argument you seem to throw everything but the kids nysnc, and even though you are having a feel day with this i am here to bring you back to into reality, because it's now like the pot calling the kettle cracked. i have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. it is almost spooky, because i cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. i have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. you just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.

they also have a humility thing where they will feel the need to lie in order to spare the person asking the question from receiving an unnecessarily truthful answer that might make the questioner uncomfortable about his own life. 100% of japanese do this. so the question itself can't even really be reliably asked to anyone.
japanese have no incentive to enter a real relationship. the men there can be fully sexually satisfied by women without ever entering a relationship.
for instance, japan has blowjob bars everywhere. ""pinsaros"".
you go in, buy a drink, and get a tender and loving blowjob from the beautiful young loli server. no condom. she has this down to a science in the way you can only expect from the japanese. she'll make you feel pleasure you didn't know your body was even capable of experiencing.
or if you really want to treat yourself, you order the ""flower petal rotation"" where three girls rotate through taking turns blowing you until you cum.
you just sit back and enjoy watching them suck your dick and listening to their cute squeaks. colorful lights flash around you and the thumping uplifting trance music plays. they swallow and gently clean the dribbled sperm off your tummy afterwards.
and from your post, i can tell you have barely even scratched the surface of their porn. keep your language set to japanese and you can find really nasty videos on dmm. my favorite are the ones where three girls are working together on a man in the following fashion: one is gently sucking his dick, one is gently licking his anus, and one is gently rubbing his nuts and tummy. all are very convincingly uttering moans of joy just from the happiness they're feeling by making the man feel pleasure. there are thousands of videos of variations this exact scenario. all real",US,,False,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1539588301188.jpg,petal,,3,248598,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,2018-10-01T00:00:00Z,1221,no

you have to understand, my silly young coomer friend, that google, bing, duckduckgo and the likes arent real ""search"" enginges. they arent meta-crawlers either. they are business own registers, controlled and groomed (alghoritms etc) by the interests of the business and it owners. 

google, bing and shit-a-like have as much to do with free speech, free flow of information and free development of the mind as a pile of bullshit has to do with a decent, loving wife cocked meal.

google was co-sponsored by the cia, and the nsa cooperates with microsoft (bing) since - at least - windows98.

you have to wake up, wannabe neo.
