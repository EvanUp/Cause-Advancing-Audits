# WE EXPLORE 3 DIFFERENT PROMPTS. WE USE PROMPT 1 FOR RESULTS, BUT ALSO DESCRIBE RESULTS FROM PROMPTS 2 AND 3.


### PROMPT 1 (USED) ####################################

promptv1 = '''
Your job is to answer the following 3 questions:

engine_comparison: Is the user recommending 1 or more search engines? 
engine_rankings: If the user is ranking engines, provide their ranking in the format: {1:"Google", 2: "Bing", 3: "Yahoo"} or an empty dictionary if no. If there's a tie, assign tied engines the same rank. 
query: A list of any queries that the user claims to have searched in one or more search engines. 

Return ONLY a json in the following format: {"engine_comparison": "yes", "engine_rankings": {}, "query": ["query"]}

Here are three example annotations:

Comment 1: ‘there are currently only two real alternatives to google search. >these two alternatives are microsoft bing and russian yandex. >when searching for “pfizer vaccine” on yandex, the first two search suggestions currently are “pfizer vaccine deaths” and “pfizer vaccine side effects”. meanwhile, on google, “pfizer vaccine” is being auto-completed to “near me”, “booster”, “fda approval”, “for kids”, or “efficacy”. https://swprs.org/how-to-escape-google/’
Correct Annotation 1: { "engine_comparison": "yes", "engine_rankings": { "Yandex":1, "Bing":1, "Google":2 }, "query": ["pfizer vaccine"] }

Comment 2: Yandex is russian search engine The method I use to determine if the search engine is following Jewish propaganda or not, is by searching for the word 'Goy', for example, if 'anti-Semitic' pictures appear, then it's probably safe. Also, I noticed that the search engine gives different search result with different browsers 'The search engine is the same, but the browser is different and it still give different search result, some browser are Jewish' so be careful guys What brought me here? I was looking for a non-Jewish PC operating system (Not Microsoft, Mac, etc..), so can you please help me?

Correct Annotation 2:{ "engine_comparison": "yes", "engine_rankings": { "Ecosia":1, "Yandex":1 }, "query": ["Goy"] }
