2,yes,">that's a pipe dream and you know it. google/apple/facebook/amazon are household names and aren't going anywhere. 
today they are, yes. again i'm not deluding myself into thinking that we're gonna convince more than a tiny fraction of the population to use duckduckgo or whatever. but half the country hates their obnoxious forcing of sjwism down everyone's throats, and wants an alternative.
>besides, californians are with the majority of the country in not trusting the chinese
the people who are turned off by google's zog shilling are not gonna let vague suspicion of the chinese prevent them from switching to baidu when it gets good enough. you're the one deluding yourself if you think they're gonna be playing catch-up forever."
3,no,"
how bad the is the state media control in hong kong anyway?

>yet is saying anti-""migrant"" shit as of late and rightfully wants them the fuck off the streets and surrounding areas of paris

it's all bullshit like i said in my first post. ironically: it's ""fake news"". just words without actions to tame the populist right and take away more rights by pretending like macron is actually doing anything to change the situation, when in fact he's allocating a bigger portion of his budget to welcome migrants than any of the last presidents.

https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=fr&ie=utf-8&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.frontnational.com%2f2017%2f11%2fbudget-2018-immigration-et-asile-macron-fait-pire-que-le-quinquennat-de-francois-hollande%2f&edit-text=&act=url
>the ranting and other effects of the interior minister gerard collomb's sleeve will not long mask the very disturbing content of the ministerial mission on immigration, asylum and integration. indeed, the 2018 budget provides for an increase of all the budget items relating to the reception of migrants and asylum policies for an amount of 300 million euros, but an unjustifiable reduction of 7 million euros of the resources allocated to the fight against illegal immigration. while the minister of the interior announces to anyone who wants to hear him that he will reinforce the controls at the national borders and improve the devices of expulsion of the clandestine migrants, he reduces at the same time the credits allocated to the centers of administrative detention and measures of removal from the national territory.

all these bullshit comments and sound bites will do is prevent a genuine nationalist like le pen from being elected because some people are fooled that macron is addressing the situation even though he isn't, and get more people to vote for even more left-wing candidates because they think macron is ""too right-wing"" even though he's pretty much a communist."
4,yes,"stop using google

for search (google's biggest money maker)
duckduckgo.com
bing.com
yandex.com

pay for your own email via a hosting provider or use protonmail.

use libreoffice or microsoft office.

use hooktube.com for youtube videos (simply make any youtube.com/whatever address into hooktube.com/whatever)

for maps use open street maps.

do not buy google phones and sanitize any android phone of as much google software as possible.

switch to brave browser and use brave wallet to support your favorite sites instead of adsense ads.

stop feeding google."
5,yes,">fuck that cult.

start by using searx instead of google

https://searx.me/

they have a better user interface than gooogle / bingbong and they're a meta search engine so whether it comes from g or b or yahoo or yandex, they don't care as long as the results are good. their search algorithm is pretty good. just try it for a day or two and you won't go back to google

if qwant.com wasn't google lite i'd recommend it too"
6,yes,"
alternatives: 

google serach engine - duckduckgo, yandex, searx 
 
gmail - tutanota, protonmail, yandex 
 
browser: opera, brave 
firefox is gay 
 
videos- bitchute"
7,yes,"fuck if i know. it's important to use alternatives, even though those alternatives are basically just copies of google. i use duckduckgo sometimes. i use yandex email all the time and russia has a rising competitor to youtube, though it has not made the effort to roll out to other parts of the world yet.

the guy who got fired from google for being a white male with a dissenting opinion--james damore i think is his name--spoke in an interview about how google search works. he had claimed in that interview that he doesn't think anybody understands how it works and that it has a mind of its own.

i think it's this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nosd0xk0r8
don't take my word for it, though. i haven't seen the video for months and could be completely mixed up."
8,yes,"don't use ddg. what the fuck is wrong with you chortlefucks? ddg is israeli. use startpage/ixquick which is basically a proxy through google with all google results. 

alternatively, use yandex as already suggested if ""google"" isn't giving what you need."
9,yes,"it's disgusting, my man. i get this feeling in my stomach like i'm going to be sick when i see it. 

google's search algorithms see anything that is pro-white as racist. our best option is to use bing, which is the second largest search engine. all the other popular search engines use searches from google. i have hopes for russian based yandex to eventually expand more in the west and become a competitor with google, but even they mix in google results with their searches."
10,yes,"anyone have a screencap or link to the article where some south african statesman said something along the lines of ""we'll let whites live... for now""

been googling/bing/yandex/duckduckgo and could not find it."
11,yes,"gab.ai is the main alternative to twitter.

dtube, steemit, bitchute, vid.me, dailymotion, pewtube are all alternatives to youtube. 

startpage, searx.me, yandex, ixquick, yahoo, bing and (((duckduckgo))) are some of the alternatives to jewgle.

the actual problem is that youtube, twitter, faceberg, google, etc. are effectively monopolies with exponential exposure and budget and if one of those services even come close to reaching a tenth of their respective marketshare they will just buy them out, or the owner will be assassinated and replaced (see rebbit). they're just too big and something more drastic will need to be done to curtail their power and influence. ""free market"" is a meme."
12,yes,yahoo is literal malware. use yandex or bing
13,yes,"good suggestions

because duckduckgo is performing well, 4th or 5th most popular referring domain while yandex is not listed. we need powerful competitors that google notice.

i will check it out. i am looking for alternatives to youtube.

it is beginner tier because most people are beginners. it is an easy way to move away from google's services. other options are also viable, thank you for providing more options.

i do contest start page, the point is not to have personal privacy, that's a plus, but to rob google of traffic and referring domains. they sell adspace for more than anyone because they are the most used. if they were not the most popular search engine, they would make much less money. it's still a core of their business and a key thing we must stop using."
14,yes,"
startpage, searx.me/findx, yandex, ixquick...

even yahoo and bing are better at this point, although i wouldn't recommend anything microshit does.

but it's gotten to the point where google isn't optimal just from a usability point of view. there's so much filtering and manipulation on google that i have to actively fight with it to find any useful information."
15,yes,"more from last thread:

[what else is google doing?]

>changes/filters results based on political leanings
>actively censoring anything right of far-left political views

>replace your search engine:

16,yes,"
you should still get rid of chrome and your gmail account if you have one because all that data you're giving them, all the images you're saving, all your search queries, the websites you're visiting, all the messages you're sending and receiving, all that info in your profile is being stored and used by them (the same people who are pushing all shit and purging dissidents, that's who you're trusting with all internet activity), then sent to other corporate bodies, adl, splc, and intelligence agencies.

other alternatives to bing and google (since microsoft isn't that good either): startpage, searx.me/findx, yandex, ixquick, yahoo... 

you can also use hooktube to mirror videos that are already on youtube."

current google alternatives: startpage, searx.me, yandex, ixquick, yahoo, bing and (((duckduckgo)))"
18,yes,"
they thought because google is ""progressive"" (meaning anti-white, anti-nationalism, pro-feminism, anti-christian, etc.), that they would be against the military-industrial complex, anti-war and ""anti-establishment"". so many of these kids get brainwashed to think they're ""fighting the system"" so when they realize they are the system or a big part of it, it always comes as a shock.


they have a better user interface than google/bing and they're a meta search engine so whether it comes from google or bing or yahoo or yandex, they don't care as long as the results are good. their search algorithm is pretty good. just try it for a day or two and you won't go back to google

then there's the more mainstream ones like yahoo or bing but i've never found them quite as good.

even duckduckgo is probably better at this point but this one is also run by a jew even if there's no big obvious agenda yet like with jewgle."
24,yes,"because it's aggregate of bing,yahoo, yandex, etc."
25,yes,"list goes
1) yandex
2) ddg
3) bing
...........

79573) google"
26,yes,"but with all that being said, i was actually asking where on the internet do you see those ukraianian screechings? is it on facebook or on some polish websites?

 i am asking because, as you may know, by 2018 internet is actually far from being as international as people think. people of different cultures gravitate towards websites of similar culture. like, say, the majority of ukrainians are watching the same videos on youtube as russians, mostly use vk for social networking and prefer yandex over google.

i wonder if at the same time some ukrainians (maybe just the western ones, maybe not) use polish websites to. or do you have them at all? i would claim that probably 90% of all posts russians make they make on specifically russian websites. i wonder what's the percentage in poland"
27,yes,"no it just aggregates google, yahoo, yandex. they should add bing."
28,yes,"for some reason i can't find the old archiving sites that we used to use on google anymore.

been trying yandex and bing and duck duck go to find some archiving sites as well but it looks like freeware websites are all gone now.

the best i could do is downloading some archiving software....

i don't remember finding archive sites being this hard before...

jesus so much for a future in which the services we knew got better and cooler. i feel like i'm slowly getting gimped on the internet and i'll be on modem again before i know it."
29,yes,"only two pages with 14 results for https://www.google.com/search?q=""a+copy+of+a+copy+of+a+copy""
archived it for future reference at http://archive.is/nsrnf and there are only 3 results.
archiving with &filter=0, only 5 results: http://archive.is/q8udn
different ip location on the archive's part, from south korea to perak.
searching ""a copy of a copy of a copy"" nine inch nails provides normal results though.
i recalled this thread:
http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/169387966
>i type cats into google expecting to be able to search millions of pages but it stops at page 21. is my country behind some kind of 'watered down search' / wall?
>see pic, please help anons i remember when you could search for days, i'd be on google page 719, and still get results, what happened? also duckduckgo is the same too.
>how can a search term like 'cats' end on page 21??? why is google and duckduckgo limiting search result returns? i tired it on yahoo and it only returned 82 pages or 820 results
>i remember when you could keep clicking page after page, you could be on say page 341 on cats and it would keep returning results.
>what kind of 'fuckery' is this now?
>...and all my fucking results are for the same jew-owned-mainstream media outlets!!!!!!??!! it might as well just give me one result and have nsa approved reading on it. 
now here's the kicker, i tried bing as well and there are 16 results: https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22a+copy+of+a+copy+of+a+copy%22
https://search.yahoo.com/search;?fr2=sb-top-search&p=""a+copy+of+a+copy+of+a+copy"" ignores the quotation marks resulting in irrelevant results like the dictionary definition of copy although you can search for other exact phrases.
https://yandex.com/search/?text=""a copy of a copy of a copy"" works although it's not such a good search engine and if the best ones are censored you may not be able to find whatever it is they're concealing."

31,yes,"i'm curious about yandex. i have websites and the three spiders i see the most are google, bing, and yandex related."
32,yes,this image just made me find out how good baidu image search is compared to google and yandex
33,yes,"yandex image search is objectively superior. it can find the original source of the most obscure nip cartoon porn even after image has been artificially blurred. 
qwant is another nice alternative for searching. at least it's a variation on google which always put the same websites first on all searches (wikipedia for general info, imdb for movies, ...) creating a fake consensus on what websites are relevant. 
for mail, use protonmail, definitely better than gmail in every respect."
34,yes,google image search is like asking a backalley stranger for help and wondering how you ended up with your kidney stolen while waking up in a tub full of ice. use tinyeye or yandex. anything but google.
35,yes,"don't be retarded. google is a megacorp because other people use it and will use it, regardless of what you try to do on your own. and ""don't use google?"" that would have to extend to things like google analytics, youtube video embeds, etc. on third-party websites. you're talking about dropping out of a large portion of the entire english-language internet. in favor of what? yandex? baidu?"
36,yes,"qwant
yandex (bonus point for being an fsb agent just simply by using it)

38,yes,instead of duckduckgo just go straight to yandex (the russian google.) duckduckgo is powered by yandex anyway
39,yes,"

40,yes,"yandex is the only one i found that seems to not be using the same algorithms/data as google.

42,yes,"yandex, yahoo, bing, wikipedia. no google in duckduckgo."
43,yes,"/pol/, i remember an old thread showing that searching ""imgsrc"" on some search engines (in images category) showed pic. related images.

there are some weird sites behind these images (click the image and look at the website where it's hosted).

somehow google managed to evade these results but other search engines didn't care filtering it all, except for yahoo and aol that managed to show ""no results"" (even if you can see some image results when you search by ""web"" instead of ""images"").

search engines tested so far:
yandex - seems like it doesn't filter these images.
google - shows non-related images
bing - doesn't filter
yahoo - does filter (shows ""no results"" when images tab is chosen) but shows some results when web tab is chosen
aol - same as previous
baidu - shows only few related images, the rest are asian related
duckduckgo - doesn't filter

while i was making this thread i found the following site: imgsrc.ru
if you manage to search enough, you can find some lewd photos of.. you know.

it's time to investigate who are behind this, /pol/.

inb4 i get shoa'd by them."
44,yes,that's why all the shills tell you to use duckduckgo. use something like yandex or bing or anything else
45,yes,"bing is as bad as google if not worse 

and yandex is ok but too many russian search results"
46,yes,"i tried bing, duckduckgo, and yandex still got nothin"
47,yes,"that’s because google is headlining news articles instead of searching for stories about trump when “trump news” is queried. do the same search on duckduckgo or yandex and post results. there’s not one article from cnn, wapo, politico, chicago tribune, or any other headlines source with the headline in the google search. anyone who was around the internet before faceberg can easily see through this nonsense"
48,yes,"honestly, funding for other search engines at this point would be the most fair, considering how much our 3 letters propped up google.
what's ""completely neutral?"" just give me competing search engines, which bing and yandex are pretty good for me."
49,yes,"uses yahoo, bing, yandex. the first two are biased. will try on my local isp with several dns servers. a couple of minutes until i boot the laptop."

51,yes,">welp time to use (((duckduckgo))) or yandex
you're not seeing the enormity of the plot.

54,yes,"fuck google, amazon, yahoo, etc. i've taken the yandex pill."
55,yes,"
google is dogshit, half the time you search you have to contemplate if they're fucking with you a la ""american inventors"" or trying to subconsciously influence you with their comically left wing search autocompletes and promoting of random transsexual revolutionaries of color 158th birthdays while keeping a blank background for any remotely non-communist event.

bing, yandex, duckduckgo, my literal fucking asshole are all better search engines now."
56,yes,yandex has always been very popular in russia since its their domestic search engine. if you want a google alternative use startpage for least botnet or duckduckgo with maybe slightly more and a better interface

60,yes,"google is no longer a good company. 

their search engine fucking blows. i have to go to duckduckgo or yandex or bing or ask.com (rip jeeves) just to search normal shit i usually got top results for on google. i have to dig to page 6 just to get anything relevant on google. and their google images are brainlet tier bullshit. search for ""dog""? hurr get lots of pictures of trump's face on a dog's body. search for ""hitler""? hurr get lots of pictures of trump. search for space? hurr get lots of pictures of trump being anally probed. you get the picture.

their email fucking sucks. nothing that protonmail can't do 100 times better. and they recently launched a new visual format that makes me reminisce of the days of the digg v3 exodus, when users cared. this kind of bullshit google is pulling with their mail should be launching mass exoduses right now! but why aren't they? i'll get to that.

their ad system fucking sucks too now. not only are tons of people blocking the ads, they're also using adnauseum, causing a lot of ad data from google to be garbage data.

let's not even get started on the captcha and how much that fucking sucks and how painfully obvious it's some shit recognition system for their ai cars. 

google's only worth right now is in their ai labs which only the beneficiaries of google get to peek at and enjoy the fruits of.

only reason people are still using google is because it has a monopoly. and by its own merit, google should not have a monopoly. it sucks, and the only reason it does is its historical advantage. now it is time for it to be destroyed and replaced.

ideas on how to achieve this, boys?"
61,yes,"if you want to use google without being tracked, you can use startpage. it is a metasearch engine which sends your request to google search without passing on identifying information to google. the company that handles this service claims not to do anything with your data, nor keep it. so you get google without the privacy concerns.

if you don't like google's results, you have another option in searx. searx is another meta-search engine which can phone to multiple different search engines, not merely google alone. you can set yourself to get results for a normal search from google, bing, and yandex, for an image search, imgur and google, or just have bing provide all your results. same deal---privacy focused.
searx.me is the url of one of the services servers."
62,yes,"i've searched yandex, baidu, bing, sogou for ""christine blasey -ford -kavanaugh -senate"" and all i ever come up with are scientific papers she's written

70,yes,"google isn't the internet and they sure filer a lot of it, not necessary by somebody watching over it, they don't even put it into their database. yandex find a lot more russian sites and baidu finds a lot more chinese sites. google can't even compete in russian or chinese site results, they are specialized to provide corporate results first and sometimes useful forums for technical stuff. google doesn't even searches through 0,1% of internet. does duckduckgo even have own servers? they are just a layer site on top of other people's servers."

73,yes,it's sad when bing and yandex are better than google
74,yes,yandex (russian) is the only real foreign competitor. bing is at almost 30% of searches. the dns/mail system are horrible relics if a real decentralized alternative appears google will lose everything.

holy fuck

israeli intelligence hq, camp gilot, has been clearly visible on google maps for some time, but was obscured on yandex, the russian rival.

the rival obscured 300 sites in israel and turkey with some of them top nuclear facilities, according to a report from the federation of american scientists (fas).

now their exact locations have been revealed as the result of the gaffe because blurring them has the opposite effect by drawing attention to them.

fas intelligence analyst matt korda said: “this blurring is almost certainly the result of requests from both israel and turkey; it seems highly unlikely that a russian company would undertake such a time-consuming task of its own volition.

“fortunately, this has had the unintended effect of revealing the location and exact perimeter of every significant military facility within both countries, if one is curious enough to sift through the entire map looking for blurry patches.

“by complying with requests to selectively obscure military facilities, the mapping service has actually revealed their precise locations, perimeters, and potential function to anyone curious enough to find them all.”

nato facilities allied land command (landcom) in izmir and incirlik air base were obscured, the report claims.

nuclear storage bases, surface-to-air missile sites, airfields, ports, bunkers and barracks are among those revealed."
83,yes,"yahoo, yandex, bing, wikipedia"
84,yes,"facebook reportedly gave some of the world’s largest tech companies access to users’ personal data, including allowing some firms to read and delete users’ private messages and obtain contact information through their friends, without users’ knowledge or consent.

the new york times on tuesday detailed how facebook, through data-sharing “business partnerships,” shared and traded user data with more than 150 companies, including amazon, microsoft, netflix, spotify, yahoo and the russian search engine yandex.

these partnerships, the oldest of which dates to 2010 and all of which were active in 2017, “effectively exempt[ed] those business partners” from facebook’s usual privacy rules, the times reported, citing hundreds of pages of internal facebook documents. 

microsoft’s bing search engine, for example, was reportedly allowed to see the names of nearly all facebook users’ friends without their consent; spotify, netflix and the royal bank of canada were able to read, write and delete users’ private messages; and amazon, microsoft and sony could obtain users’ contact information through their friends.

yahoo and yandex reportedly retained access to facebook user data even after such access was supposed to have been halted. and facebook gave apple the power to see facebook users’ contacts and calendar entries even in cases where users had disabled all data sharing. (yahoo is owned by verizon, which also is huffpost’s parent company.)

in all, the data of “hundreds of millions of people” were sought monthly by applications made by these facebook business partners, according to the times. some of these partnerships reportedly remain in effect today."
85,yes,"gen-x and boomer coders who have been there since the beginning are still there in r&d and haven't retired yet, but they never show them as representative of the company, only these mystery meat s-o-y-cucks. the turbo-autists and some asians also help keep it afloat. however, search engines are becoming increasingly irrelevant and the core infrastructure hasn't changed much since the 90s. most normies are directed to the small number of mega-sites through social media these days rather than search engines, and there are increasing amounts of alternative search engines that are becoming more popular, for both english speakers and internationally (duckduckgo, bing, yandex, baidu etc). google''s adwords based revenue stream is only being propped up by the seo trend from companies wanting to get to the top of search engine results, but when companies start cutting back on their marketing budgets when they realise normies aren't googling their business anymore, their revenue will crash and then their share price under the size of their mammoth budget."

91,yes,"google is the only search engine that actually does it, yandex or bing won't i (((wonder))) why?"
92,no,"while all criminals in russia can get amnesty, russian nationalists are the only that will never get it. while a non-white got 1 year imprisonment for killing a russian biker, the organizer of the""northern brotherhood"" got 9 years imprisonment. the russian government blacklisted many pro-white and ns materials (books, videos, music, etc.) such as hitler´s ""mein kampf"" and created the""federal list of extremist materials"" which should serve as a national registry of these materials. in russia, people can be blacklisted forever (for ""extremism""). after it crushed the nationalist movement, the russian government focused on the internet and it became a priority to fight nationalism on the internet. putin himself called for creating barrier to extremism propaganda in internet. the russian authorities ordered russian bloggers to register and use online boots to find and block ""extremist"" websites. the fsb (successor to the kgb) considered the popular communication services skype, gmail and hotmail as ""national threat"" and wanted to ban them (this plan was cancelled) and even want to ban the tor anonymity network in russia. the fsb has now access to the correspondence of users of googlemail, yahoo, yandex.ru, mail.ru, rambler.ru, aport.ru, rupochta.ru, hotbox.ru, icq, etc. as a result of these laws and the focus on the internet, hundreds of people are now prosecuted annually for these thought crimes, including sometimes simply sharing a ns/ wn song or a pro-white video in social networks. although the usa is infected with the poison cultural marxism (which will lead to white genocide) and controlled by jews and their lackeys, you actually have more freedom in usa (and even in europe to some degree) than in putin´s russia. stormfront and other white nationalist websites would never exist with servers based in russia. in the usa, you are able to fight against the white race, while you can´t do it in russia because you would be arrested."

use yandex or another competitive search engine to google. don't use anything which just pulls google's results, either, like duckduckgo."
95,yes,"i personally use a mix of ecosia (based on bing but with a hippy focus), searx, yandex and a google proxy hosted at chiru.no (https://chiru.no/a/search/?search)."
96,yes,"i have zero issues with google. it might censor/push stuff it wants forward, but it perfectly fulfills its core function - when you go ""search"" something, you usually know what you want to find and not just randomly browsing around google results catalogue. its assumed, searching a subject you can also evaluate validity and helpfullness of search results on your own. and google search/ranking algorithms are just too good compared to copetition, so even knowing its pushes agenda, spies etc. its still the most convenient.

meanwhile, i can assure you if you want more ""unfiltered"" results, just use bing/yahoo. the huge difference between them and google is evident from just searching say porn in image search - google filters all content strictly, meanwhile those two simply dont have mechanics/stuff to actually do all that job, so whatever search results you`d get likely to be the honest/unfiltered ones. not because they don't want to be like google, but because they can't/lack resources.

duckduckgogo is kind of useless, aside if you want to search for illegal materials/tor sites and don't want to leave the trace. or on principe don't want your data being sold to advertisers.

yandex is good - its one company that actively tries to improve and compete with google (unlike yahoo/bing), but its designed primarily for runet and russian languages sites in mind.

just don't get your news from google, find sources and relevant newssites/forums yourself and you should be safe from its ""influence"" for most part."

104,no,"holy shit, i just checked out some articles about how russia's yandex maps (google earth equivalent) fucked up a few months ago and revealed the locations of israeli icbm sites. i checked out a shitload of coordinates and historical uncensored sat imagery from chinese/turkish satellites of these locations and this is huge.

you guys have to understand the implications of this and what placement of nuclear missiles means. in the us, you have minuteman silos in minot afb, north dakota, malmstrom afb, montana, and warren afb, wyoming which are completely sequestered away from major civilian population centers. they do this because in the event of a counterforce exchange (attacking military targets with nukes) there isn't collateral damage against big cities/metropolitan areas in the hope that they can de-escalate the developments via the red phone to avoid ""counter value"" exchanges i.e. nuking st. petersburg and nyc out of revenge.

the same is the case in the uk and france. hmnb clyde and the trident subs are tucked into scottish lochs with high elevation to shield civilians from the blast waves. the french force de dissuasion has its subs placed at audierne bay where there's relatively fuck all civilians.

in israel their icbm sites are literally planted ontop of the jews right near massive civilian centers. one ballistic missile submarine hitting those jericho sites would cause a literal holocaust in terms of dead jews. this means israel does not control their nukes and the purpose of them isn't to defend israeli jews. this implies they are being held to ransom and israel doesn't have sovereignty and is controlled by some other entity. i can fucking attest that this is of note, i've not designed c3i location masking technology for the us navy, in minecraft."

107,yes,"he also unironically says ethnonationalists are supremacists and you can tell that they are because often arguments come down to iq

he is claiming white nationalists are white supremacists because they talk about iq, even though every white nationalist who talks about iq points out that asians have a higher average iq than whites.

i'd like him to show me even one commentator on the alt-right who would argue on camera that whites have superior iq of all races. one person. 

but he can't. because it's a shit-smelling strawman he pulled out of his ass.

many on the alt-right would be the first to explain that west africans (incl. jamaicans) are the fastest sprinters, that east africans (kenyans and ethiopians) make the best long-distance runners, that the nepalese make better guides in high-altitude settings like mt everest, etc..

by denying racial differences, tiny here is basically saying the nba is a racist organization because it hires too many black people and not enough asians. even though asians are genetically pre-disposed on average to be shorter than blacks, which puts them at a distinct disadvantage in the sport of basketball.

by the same token, he'd argue that silicon valley tech firms like apple, google, microsoft, amazon, yahoo!, etc are racist because they hire too many asians and not enough blacks, even though asians are genetically pre-disposed to being more intelligent than blacks on average.

this, despite the pressure from sjws and the diversity officers in their own hr departments that are constantly hunting and competing for black software engineers on campuses across the country."

142,yes,"since i'm fairly certain the bong has tucked his tail between his legs and ran off, let's review lurkers.

regardless of the search engine you use, which should be startpage, searx, or w/e else you prefer besides ddg, you should be using umatrix and noscript with that. you should block google analytics and quite frankly, anything that has to do with analytics or sounds like it. some might break pages and you'll have to tinker with it to see what works best for you and what doesn't.

if you do not do this, not only is your data being sold, but you are having a profile built on you for use of how to control and manipulate you.
if you are a big enough problem to the powers that be, deep state, et al; then that data will be used to locate and destroy you.

cheers."
143,yes,">>166821733

144,yes,"you're welcome anon. i would not use google anymore if i were you and use startpage or searx. it will serve you better. it doesn't surprise me too much that google is doing their best to bury how the hegelian dialectic applies to today and instead gives the generic explanation that leaves the person with questions unsolved.

177,yes,"you can only trust these not to be logging your every search and sending to nsa. 

but i think it's safe to assume they're not sharing with companies esp google. you can trust that google is doing that. these alt-search engines don't have a huge ecosystem that can track you everywhere which is nice. these are great for escaping your search bubble and probably not being logged. 

bing is better than startpage/google for finding dcma pirated stuff too. google gets all the complaints.

am i right that searx is basically the same as startpage except that it sends queries to bing? i saw bing mentioned in an error on the image search once for searx.

and duckduckgo makes its own index? if searx is not bing, then does it index too?"
178,yes,"searx is an aggregate of multiple search engines (and you get to choose which ones to use >>199268093) as opposed to startpage which only uses google

if you're actually looking for a search engine, use lite.qwant.com or searx.me"
181,yes,"if you want privacy, then the only ones that you can fully trust are ungoogled-chromium and gnu/icecat. iridium is also good, but it has a very small problem (which you can turn off in its config).

for search engines, stick to searx and startpage."
182,yes,"ungoogled-chromium + searx.me || startpage as search engine.

183,yes,"""google safebrowsing"" is turned on by default on iridium, all you have to do is uncheck the option in pic related.

startpage uses google's results, so it's like an alternative to google, but its domain is still in the us and i don't know if the site is fully open-source.

searx on the other hand is fully open source and its domain is .me, it's more trustable than startpage but might have inferior results."

is startpage really any better? anyway, it doesn't matter unless you're connecting over tor--you're already pwned"
186,yes,"good point.
i'm starting to notice the same.
my filtered searches aren't returning much inbetween 2000-2005.
i think i'll take your approach to it (general search and let google/searx.me/duckduckgo do the work first), once i've exhausted those links i'll move onto a more granular search approach."
187,yes,"ignore anyone suggesting arch, manjaro, antergos, or any arch derivatives in general. the software they ship with is awful, but pseuds like to use them because they *think* they're ""minimal"" or require skill to use. 
debian, fedora unironically, ubuntu minimal, gentoo - these are your best options. don't use duckduckgo, use searx, startpage, or minds instead. 
if you like kde use falkon or if you like google chrome just use ungoogled chromium, both will work fine."
188,yes,"i don't know or care about what tor uses by default because i don't use it. i2p, a vpn, and a private dns are sufficient for my usecase. in the case of search engines, duckduckgo is owned by a kike who used to run a data aggregation company. this alone should be enough to avoid it. also, it is only partially open source. searx, minds, and startpage are all reliable alternatives to crap like google and ddg. 
if you want a distro to start out with that isn't complete trash, consider using the ubuntu minimal install .iso - it allows you to select what software groups you might want to install, and what software groups you might not want to install. that doesn't mean ubuntu isn't bloated, it's just a simple way of getting rid of crap like their default de. actually, you might also want to consider fedora to be a better alternative to ubuntu, because it's the only distro that uses a binary repo and properly integrates systemd (no other distro properly integrates systemd, which is why it's often called a frankenstein.) brave is also a piece of shit and just doesn't work well in comparison to ungoogled chromium (it's chrome browser but free of google botnet), as well as more older reliable alternatives like falkon browser (kde) and gnu icecat. also, steer clear of the arch-reddit cult. arch and its derivatives are complete trash and the default install presents a ton of serious security flaws - like an allyesconfig kernel - but the reddit r/unixporn cult will drill it into your head that it's some kind of savior distro."
189,yes,"palemoon (firefox fork) was borderline tolerable. firefox is the second best, but by a long shot. you should be on the lookout for a firefox fork in general because these things are open source and many people distribute their own versions with varying privacy and security.

addons matter, a ublock and noscript combination is a pretty solid basic one you can find on many firefox-type browsers. also try to look for addons like cookie autodelete (configure it to destroy or preserve cookies upon closing a tab), a website rating tool (so that you can positively rate redpilled websites) and referer control (hides which site you came from when clicking a link). the limit is where it starts making your browsing experience slow.

try searx.me

startpage is good but it's just a google proxy with privacy features. you might want to diversify your choice."
190,yes,"recommended alternatives

none of this proves that duckduckgo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. these are some suggestions.

 startpage/ixquick

 these search engines are both run by the same company. startpage gets its results from google, meaning that it's google minus tracking, and ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not google. both give equivalent privacy. which one to use is a matter of preference.the company is based in the netherlands, and it has servers located in the us and the eu. it is advisable to configure it to use only eu servers in the settings. there are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. it also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable url, in order to avoid cookies. it takes privacy very seriously.

 searx

 searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to startpage and ixquick, but with less privacy features. its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. this means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. there are many other instances which provide the same features. this makes it very hard for agencies like the nsa to compromise it. even if searx is controlled by the nsa, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.

191,yes,"searx.me is actually getting good for searching obscure stuff that the google ones won't find.
duckduckgo uses the google webcrawler and is censored like google."
192,yes,searx or startpage both are .com. searx is open source but american and uses a mix all all engine searches. start page is dutch but eu has ungodly privacy laws and uses mostly google engine searches but unblocks the google ones that normally aren't allowed.
193,yes,"switch to startpage/ixquick, you don't deserve to have globohomo shit shoved in your face every time you search. although startpage still shows google results for the most part, it doesn't manipulate the results and has privacy enhancement features. it will be easier to then switch to a search engine not manipulated by google at all, like searx. i'm at the startpage phase now and never looked back.

btw duckduckgo is hosted by (((gabriel weinberg))), a guy who used to run a database before creating the search engine."
194,yes,"this. startpage is really, really good, it helps you detox from google and transition to more free alternatives like searx."
195,yes,"use invidio.us (and newpipe in your phone) to watch youtube videos without giving google your data.

checked.
it is worthy of mention that he also very regularly talks about how most people in the organisations are great people but that he didn't like the way things were going. in effect taking a fence-shitting stance of where noone is responsible and all you can do is just groan quietly in the distance hoping that someone else starts joining him in the leak (which will never come, since he will report their identity).

none of this proves that duckduckgo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. these are some suggestions.

 startpage/ixquick
 these search engines are both run by the same company. startpage gets its results from google, meaning that it's google minus tracking, and ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not google. both give equivalent privacy. which one to use is a matter of preference.the company is based in the netherlands, and it has servers located in the us and the eu. it is advisable to configure it to use only eu servers in the settings. there are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. it also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable url, in order to avoid cookies. it takes privacy very seriously.
 searx
 searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to startpage and ixquick, but with less privacy features. its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. this means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. there are many other instances which provide the same features. this makes it very hard for agencies like the nsa to compromise it. even if searx is controlled by the nsa, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible."

searx #1 for the source and instances and how easy it is to self host aka lots of instances to pick from lots of countries.

but realistically ddg is great. you can do bangs like !g to use googles indexers if you want. also you can watch yt on their end rather than yours. 
ddg also put a lot of funds towards privacy projects and the eff (which is good)
they have 1%~ market share which is pretty good right now. if decent searchers like themselves combined for 5% the internet would be a better safer place much less resistant to censorship.

brave is also really good recent controversy notwithstanding. great for aces and normies. it accomplishes 98% of what you'd get with all the security firefox plugins and other dicking around.

their recent issue was they would autocomplete crypto domains like binance with their referral id attached, but it wasn't hidden in the url or anything and theres an option to disable this.

i was looking into this theory for a while but i realized i was wrong.

kikes have thousand of years experience in sniffing out the intricate secrets of their host. sometimes masquerading as white. sometimes as arabs. (never as blacks afaik but those can be bought.)

so it came as no surprise when the biggest search engine analyser [www.searchenginewatch.com] was revealed to me as a kike puppet, that spends a lot of hours to make sure there is no technology within the search market they have missed.

if it's on the internet, they know about it, but having tentacles and periscopes inside enemy territory is useful to see what they're up to.
no need to shut down everything. just that which gets normies attention and cause them to ask questions.

good post and jpg. so added to it for my personal use.
the problem with right-wingers is that they fight fair. they argue knowledge and logic because they know it's right (no pun intended), instead of attacking friends and family from behind.

g.) exercise your right to own tools for self defense
h.) vote and push for transparency in the vote-counting process"
295,yes,">a.) remove your social media accounts
>b.) refrain from supporting google. use alternative search engines (duckduckgo, gibiru, searx, swisscows) and email accounts (protonmail)
that is the opposite of what you want to do. you want to your social media to post about what is happening so more people become aware of it. if you as a person that is in the know stop using social media where does the message go? it goes away like your presence on social media."
296,yes,"ok, i understand that its not purely a browser but ive gotten more red pilled results using searx than just plain google or duckduckgo. as i understand it creating an actual browser is quite resource intensive. like you need to parse the entire internet and then make sense of it all, an agregator does not need to bother and can pull from pre parsed data. most pilled info still shows on google and duckduck but its like so far down you will never see it. searx can help that."
297,yes,"the prc is increasingly belligerent because they see that their future suddenly isn't so bright. the ""trade war"" with the west is hurting their economy far more than ours'. they're experiencing black-outs in major cities from sky-rocketing energy prices. 

help hit them in the wallets by turning off the news, using duckduckgo, searx, gibiru, swisscows instead of google, using protonmail or gmx instead of gmail, and removing social media applications from your devices. don't buy any of their movies or media, and get a good vpn. be vocal about your love for the west.

298,yes,"why are (((they))) winning? 

they're winning because they have monopoly power and we have fewer and fewer alternatives to consuming their products and thus lining our enemies' pockets.

we can still defeat them, but we must stop using youtube, facebook, cnn, twitter, google, gmai before it's too late and they hold all of the cards.

here is a list of alternatives to (((their))) revenue sources.

watch/stream/upload: utreon, bitchute, dailymotion, twitch, vevo, vimeo, gumroad, yts.mx, popcorntime, the pirate bay

email: protonmail, gmx, yandex, tutanota, mailfence

browse: firefox, opera, safari, tor browser, brave, vivaldi, torch

search: searx, swiss cows, duckduckgo, gibiru

news: newsmax, skynews, global news, project veritas, heritage foundation, hoover institute, the daily caller, the intercept, the blaze, breitbart

social: 4chan, discord, parler, mastodon, gab, mewe, rumble

other: openssh, gpg, nordvpn, mailspring, thunderbird, iterm, clementine, crypt3, aescrypt

delete chrome and install firefox. set your default search engine to duckduckgo or searx. stop using facebook, youtube, twitter. stop reading or even giving page impressions to cnn, the washington post etc...

even if it's a videogame or a movie--if it expresses identity politics, marxism, and is aimed at demoralizing westerners and rewriting our history then don't purchase it. you have torrents and other options to getting what you want without helping them. 

furthermore, make your voice heard, but do so on the platforms that support us. speaking out on twitter is exactly what they want--they want to censor you, remove you, and make a spectacle of it so you either comply and become an npc, or are displayed in a pathetic light as to help their own movement. if you use their apps, speak out, otherwise delete them completely and help rebuild an alternative world that welcomes us."
299,yes,"at minimum use firefox, turn off cnn, use torrents, use searx or duckduckgo instead of google, use protonmail instead of gmail and use whatever you can to stay away from youtube, twitter, facebook. 

that's all you need to do. it's no more complicated than doing those things above. if a even a million of us do that, we'll be taking tens to hundreds of millions from (((them))). they'll feel it."

switch to startpage, searx or qwant. i get that bing has top-tier image search but even garbage like ddg is preferable to bing.


they claim to be decentralised through torrents but what they do not mention is that all the torrents are hosted from their own servers, thus making it useless for decentralisation and even more useless as a ""cost-saving measure"" as they claim. they also claim to be free of censorship but, from the previous one, them delisting a video means it is gone from their servers and as such is gone for everyone.

319,yes,"daily reminder that sentinel dvpn is the only vpn you can verifily trust with any other vpn you will never know what happens on their closed of server, unlike the smartcontract sentinel dvpn uses 

https://www.sentinel.co/

besides the shilling of the best vpn out there.
here's my reccomendation to you faggots, get yourself a 5$ virtual server and host your own decentralized services such as invidious (youtube alternative), searx (meta search engine capable of showing duckduckgo, startpage and google (kek) ), there's also syncthing which enables you to sync file directories on any kind of devices (you dont even need a virtual server for this)

check this list out, im sure you'll find something really really cool here, moneyback guarantee if you dont find atleast one cool service here.

also sell your unused bandwith to fellow neets now by booting up a sentinel node.

the reason i ask is because bing results are very sensitive to user agents and often don't appear in searx. i would prefer to have a mixture of bing a google results. i find that google-based search enginges (duckduckgo, startpage) tend to provide more relevant results, whereas bing-based engines (qwant) tend to provide less censored results. i'm looking for the best of both worlds."

in the short term i use yandex, but it is not decentralised, just russian"
352,yes,"doesn't searx use duckduckgo results?
nice try but these search engines all lick each other balls, when they should be independent. google scans sites and puts them in database, they leave out what they don't like. every search engine should scan for sites, this way they won't have similar search results."
353,yes,">mastodon has no space for the right so fuck that
you probably met with mastodon.social (a huge sjw instance). mastodon is just software that lets you set up your own ""twitter"" with your own rules and peer with users from other instances. and aside from it there's a similar software called pleroma, which has more free instances like shitposter.club, anime.website and kiwifarms.cc
>searx?
search engine that feeds from jewgle, bing, yandex and dozens of other places (you can choose them) without giving them your data. it also lets you host and set up your own instance.
>is that chrome but blue?
is ungoogled-chromium. it basically is jewgle chrome minus any of jewgle's crap.

>i guess they started censorship
and that's why you don't put all your eggs in one basket.

>is there anything bad i should know about odysee?
their tos may get you banned over ""certain"" content and the web front end (odysee) isn't open source, making it harder to have a non-cucked version of it."

357,yes,"again, i don't expect a retard like you to understand.

>a) i can just use duckduckgo because searx gets the results from better search engines but slower
what is it about ""aggregating"" you're too stupid to understand?
>b) that is not a reason for librefox that is a reason against waterfox, librefox is still shit
except librewolf comes with many of the hardened privacy settings by default, and waterfox doesn't. the whole point of using something like librewolf is privacy and security; the merits of which are clearly lost on a moron like yourself.

https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/browsers.html"
360,yes,"i'm just generally angry these days and there are so many bots and jdf kikes on here that it is relentless.
searches have been almost completely ruined in the last 5-10 years, it is deliberate. it just comes out with the same controlled top ten sites.
you have to eliminate keywords and go for only factual sites.
my search was by not including anything to do with the 'vaccine' or 'covid', and only searching for ""mrna gene therapy"", because that is the name of the technology.
then you have to ignore all the recent propaganda and disinfo, so you can add ""-vaccine"" if necessary.
advanced searches can include dates, so only information older than january, 2020 are included.
if you want more varied results, i recommend using
https://searx.info - or one of the other 'searx' search engine mirrors.
on that, go to preferences at the top, and then 'engines', and eliminate google/wikipedia etc etc, and include some of the less mainstream search engines.
'mojeek' is a supposedly truly independent search engine, but it has limited results due to the database not being very large yet.
it is perhaps the only completely independent search engine that i have found in several years of searching.
the others are almost all based on other engines, google, yahoo, bing etc.
there are also some technical/scientific search engines designed for experts, you'll have to search for those yourself, they aren't for normal use."
361,yes,"compare google or other search engines - if any exist from 2001 to now.
even from 2010 to now.
they are useless, deliberately broken and noticeably worse every six months.
10 years ago and for 15 years before that, you could search for ""old man helps kid time travel skateboard"" and it would come out with the name of the film/series/episode/game/cartoon. try it now and it puts up a list of amazing links to buy skateboards, or half a dozen articles about how skateboarding is racist.
this is all intentional, search engines are crippled, and if you can't find the information, it might as well not exist.
note also that there are almost zero alternatives to google/bing/yahoo. everything else is just using those as its basis. just a few years ago, bing still gave different results, now they are almost identical to google, and just as useless.
everything has been passed through an extremely narrow funnel, so everyone is experiencing the same experiences, finding the same results, and thinking the same thoughts - it is to create a cattle mindstate.
the only real alternative, so they claim, that i have found, is mojeek, which says it was built from the ground up, and remains separate. results are fewer, but it is slightly more accurate.
then there is searx, a meta search where you can select which engines are used in the preferences. eliminating google etc, and even duckduckgo from it helps somewhat.

this, combined with everything else that has been happening and is happening now especially, is turning humanity into battery chicken farms. living the bare minimum of an identical life to satisfy the basic, reconstructed needs, the smallest living space possible, and the blandest, cheapest feed possible.
eat the insects, live in a pod, take the vaccine, consume netflix, think this opinion, don't think that opinion."
362,yes,">to find a website with real info is like the ancient days in the 90s; you actually have to know the address.
accurate. it is like the time before search engines were functional, in the early 90s when the www was new. given how quickly they ban domains they don't like - see piratebay, it will soon regress to the point where you have to know the ip address of the server you want to connect to, and honestly i've been thinking of noting down server ips for a few years now.
almost every useful site is not only buried in a pile of useless shit, but disappeared from search results completely. it is their favourite action of shadowbanning - see twitter and youtube. a useful video with real information? shadowbanned so you can't search for it, and if it persists then and its channel are wiped like they never existed.
this shadoowbanning/delisting has killed good websites that were highly useful before, because all traffic has been redirected to (((chosen))) sites for a decade or more. the people running the good sites see their visitor numbers go down, and even if it is a totally free site done by volunteers or hobbyists, they shut them down because there is simply no one coming that hasn't been coming for the last 10 years, before the site was memory-holed.

yandex uses the yahoo search engine but with less/different filtering.
try https://searx.info or one of the other searx using sites, go to preferences/engines and choose which engines you want it to search on. it has yandex on the list too. seems to be more useful for specific searches."
363,yes,"not really. google only shows you what it wants, and what it thinks you want.
get around this by using metasearch engines like searx, yacy, or metager to get based results again"
364,yes,"a mix of duckduckgo and ecosia for kosher results since the feeds from bing, and yandex and searx (meta search engine that feeds from multiple engines) for everything else.
using a single search engine is a bad idea, not only because it ties you to a single globohomo corp, but because each engine brings different results, so you can see the way each one of them push their own agenda and get a more complete view by comparing their results."
365,yes,"just use tor with a bridge
searx, duckduckgo, yandex (russian alphabet boys)
no
no

366,yes,"lulz, that's is what i love about niggers like yourself. you make even the stupidest of white people look like fucking geniuses. the amount of fail...that you produce is astounding. i don't use...google...at all. i run either duckduckgo, bing...or searx. i don't use...social media...at all. anddddddd the tools i use...make you mammy envious. not that a nigger like yourself would understand what a 'tool' was anyway."
367,yes,"yes, use duckduckgo, startpage or searx."
368,yes,"bing's market stratergy is to essentially lisence their search queries to other providers with their own gimmicks and better reputations, collecting cut. ddg, ecosia, quant and others are just straight up bing with the same results. google actually lisences startpage on desktop with very strict terms, while startpage mobile is bing due to microsoft's leniency. true meta search engines like searx violate the terms of service and are essentially pirate search engines run by /g/ and stallman types. gigablast and others are independant. i've yet to find a single engine that can find trs radio or certain media unfriendly terms."
369,yes,"> hasn't heard of yandex, duckduckgo, searx, yacy, etc."
370,yes,"ddg it's like bing back in the days. 
sometimes searx servers hit the api limit of the search engines that they query i guess, so they become useless. any server you can suggest?
yandex had a good reverse search engine for media back in the days. now the gap is closing."
371,yes,"only use yt for relaxing videos, music or painting tutorials, and use an extension that blocks out any degenerate or mainstream channels. i'll check out peertube but this will be the hardest to drop. i heard odysee is another site people use as an alternative to bitchute, but others say it's also compromised, idk which one is true.

how good or trustworthy are searx or yacy search results? i've never heard of them, guessing they are new.
>ungoogled chromium
so google chrome again? i thought brave was supposed to be this? is it still resource intensive? does it support extensions?
sorry if i sound like a retard, i just never heard of these, everyone is always recommending brave, duckduck go, basically what you're saying to avoid"
372,yes,"yes, google has changed for the worse in the past few years, and completely intentionally. it will now censor and deliberately omit certain pages containing ""problematic"" content and push you into other ones that push the current narrative. the scamdemic has definitely pushed it over the edge, but the trend was already there before. it's no longer a search engine but a kind of wikipedia for the narrative. anything that's outside of it will be eventually pruned. a shame really because its algorithm was very good.

the only decent search engine that i know of is searx.me but it lacks in many areas compared to google, but it's a bit less censor-happy.

>this product is a shell of its old self, why did it stop working?

do you really have to ask?"
373,yes,"
yes they censor, yes they sell top spots to advertisers, use yandex or bing or a searx instance. 

google ceased working when they got woke, they started to rely on purchasing small companies to get ip since their trannies could no longer develop new products, then they started to monetize everything, then they started to censor things. yippi.com was a good newcomer but it seems that it has imploded and its web address have been bought by duckduckgo."
374,yes,"searx.info

or look for other searx mirrors - it is an open source meta search engine. to use it properly, go to the properties/engines and select which engines you want it to use.

here's the real kicker: 
when switching to duckduckgo or startpage, you suddenly realize their results are based almost entirely on google prefetches. bing is the only one that lists thomas edison and ben franklin on the top list, but it's still riddled with ""mixed"" results."
398,no,">there is no good alternative
what is ecosia?
what is bing?
what is duckduckgo?"
399,yes,"does google/youtube tailor their search results towards a political agenda? why do i have to use bing just to find good videos of trump? why are all of the first results on youtube when you search ""trump"" always cnn/nbc's channel?"
400,yes,">bing bang theory 
that's why i use duckduckgo

>big bang theory we start talking of electrons, protons, energy, neutrons and so on
enlightened people seeking knowledge will ask scientists about these matters. theists looking only to pick a fight will demand atheists explain the entire breadth of cosmology, philosophy and biology to them and nit-pick whatever atheists might get wrong, then claim some sort of pyrrhic special olympics victory."
401,yes,just use bing or duckduckgo. only a fool uses google.
402,yes,switch to duckduckgo or bing. don't give google any more money in ad-revenue.
403,no,"oh, and they've been completely scrubbed off google / bing / yahoo."
404,yes,doing an image search on bing and google gives me black people.
405,yes,">use bing for searches (they literally pay you to search on there)

that's basically switching from google to microsoft. use duckduckgo instead"
406,yes,"you should drop everything google related altogether
bing is ok but microsoft is still swamp-tier. use duckduckgo or startpage.
for the browser, brave is alright"
407,yes,"ddg and most ""alternative"" search engines just pull their results from google and bing/yahoo anyways. none of them implement their own crawlers or algorithms."
408,yes,did it on bing google yahoo and duckduckgo
409,yes,">duckduckgo: nothing
>yahoo: nothing
>google: a few disturbing results of children in innocent but arguable compromising positions
>bing: full on pedo gallery

what the fuck? am i on a watch list now?"
410,yes,it does all the time. try yahoo or bing not google...
411,yes,"you think that's bad? just take into consideration 
>the facebook pedo survey
>the shitposter holocaust on social media
>the conservative holocaust on social media
>the weird, degenerate ""children"" videos on youtube
>the ""how to have s*x with children"" auto fill youtube had to ""fix""

say nigger one too many times on youtube and they'll shut it down, say nigger once on facebook and you'll get a 30 day ban. 
google, facebook and twitter have employed a collective 25,000 people to monitor and police right win content on their platforms and the kid fucking?
well... i looked into this image and it is 100% true. google, bing, yahoo, duckduckgo, all index russian pedophile bait.

but if you google ""american inventors"" in english, you get a bunch of niggers

if you google it in spanish you get actual american inventors.

i wrote an article about this for free bird media which i hope they have the balls to publish."
412,yes,"
interestingly, google does the best job of keeping the pedo shit off their platforms. or maybe it just knows me better and personalizes its recs for what i want? yahoo and bing both recommend stuff that looks decidedly dodgy - but not nearly as much as duckduckgo. and all three of the big ones you claim are policing fashy content? suggest 'daily stormer' when i get to 'daily s' and link to the daily stormer when i search for it."
413,yes,"i used lycos the most i think
it was really that or askjeeves/yahoo/altavista or a buncha other no names"
414,yes,"if that's the case, please give us some alternatives that aren't pozzed. askjeeves, dogpile, lycos, something. until we get some idea of what's better than ddg, the idea of using the little jew seems better than the big jew."
415,yes,"the internet isn't really the internet anymore.
the internet was free and open. now it's controlled. distorted. mediated. 
funny, i'm a 30 year old boomer. the internet back in the 90s and the 2000s was a completely different animal. 
it was democratic. multifaceted. now it's run by just a handful of corporations. 
i thought the internet was going to be the salvation of humanity. finally information would be free and fair accessible to everyone. for a brief moment in 2016 it seemed like that was finally happening.
now they're shutting it down.
for example, who knew that in the end people would be so fucking sheepish that they all literally had to use the same god damn search engine just because it happened to be the most popular one?
like why the fuck is google basically the only search engine people use? more than 90% of traffick goes through them. back in the 90s there were like 20 that everyone knew, from google, yahoo, askjeeves, lycos, webcrawler and many others (those are just the ones i remember).
fucking sad man.
this is humanity's failure. humanities sheepish and overly trendy, hive-mentality, failure."
416,yes,"> impossible - the bar to entry is insane

how? there are dozens of search engines out there right now. they aren't all run by insanely wealthy companies. lycos? startpage? dogpile? excite? these aren't multibillion dollar companies. fuck, a lot of developers can build their own small shitty search engines for almost nothing. no, this is literally false. the bar to entry is probably about $300,000 - $500,000 by my estimate.

> even if you have money you wont get the audience

infowars had millions of subscribers. if you add that to basically everyone on the right wing who is wick of leftist propaganda and would prefer something else, i think this would be in the tens maybe even hundreds of millions.

> (ie ms with all its money cant compete with goog) 

can't compete directly with google. this is not direct competition with google because it's providing a different service. it's like opening a vanilla ice cream shop next to an already established, highly popular vanilla ice cream shop...yeah, it's going to be tough/impossible. but if you open a strawberry ice cream shop next door to one that has vowed to stop serving strawberry, then you aren't in direct competition. google promotes leftist information, this would promote right wing information. it's not direct competition."
417,no,"google facebook twitter amazon are all cia. funded, supported, protected. they *are the government, they were always intended to be. without the cia google would be another altavista or lycos or yahoo. who was paying for google and youtubes servers for ten years with no ads? that was an investment. and they will get their returns, unskippable ads that skirt around broadcast rules, for example advertisments arent legally supposed to be 2x loud than the content, selling user info, statistics, nothing is free, and we will all pay the price for trusting these monstrously evil entities."
418,yes,"life wasn't that much simpler, we had instant messenger, and online gaming. i even remember being in 3rd grade in the early 90s when i would use profusion as a search engine because it pulled results from all of the other search engines like lycos altavista yahoo aol etc. i think life really changed when google monopolized the internet."

420,yes,well....yeah? google has been absolutely required for the past 20 years. what? you want me to use yahoo or godforbid lycos?
421,yes,"that's kinda wrong though, 81-87ish was it's own sub generation that doesn't really fit with x or y

old enough to grow up on dialup and floppy disks and before everyone had cell phones let alone everyone had smart phones, old enough to remember columbine and be in school when it happened

that chart lists google for millenials, but the earlier half didn't use google that shit didn't exist, we used yahoo, altavista, lycos, infoseek, askjeeves, excite, aol (ick), dogpile, etc."
422,yes,"thanks for reply, i also tend to cross if needed, and mostly don't use google except as last resort if things aren't hitting on any of the others. only the 2nd or so time i've heard of yandex and i don't know much about it. i'll have to look into it's privacy record.
too bad i can't just revert to altavista and lycos."
423,yes,"if you are going to do the ""google your own name"" shit.
run it through at least the following
duckduckgo
yippy
bing
google
yahoo
metacrawler
webcrawler
hotbot
startpage
ecosia
ask
yandex
lycos
baidu
altavista
swisscows
aol
excite
blekko
exalead
waybackmachine
metager

click through every single result, even if it looks like nothing to do with you.

that is just the beginning. now do it for all connections you found to your name. rinse repeat. then try things backwards, with weird spaces, birth date numbers etc.

it should take you a minimum of a week of 12 hour days to get half way done."
424,yes,"it was basically the wild west. nothing had been centralized, you had to dig harder when using search engines and you would use at least 2-3 search engines instead of just google. such as lycos, yahoo, hotbot, altavista, ask jeeves. 

you could download pirated games directly from websites (like happyhippo.com) without worry and up until about 1999 those sites were immune from prosecution because the feds couldn't understand much about the internet back then. 

the web felt a lot bigger and wider than it does today because every website was self hosted and not uniform in any way. 

people would join small but bustling web forums in the early 00's for just about every type of subject matter.

cable internet existed in the 90's, and if like me you were fortunate to have it, you were invincible. still, even 56k and even 36k modems were tolerable. it was slow, but tolerable. 

if you wanted to download a program, you would use a program like getright which would resume a download where it left off in case you got disconnected. 

thats about all i can say for now because of the text limit."
425,yes,"there was still yahoo, lycos, webcrawler and altavista"
426,yes,">>>avoid google....
can you/we even avoid google at this point honestly? there really isn't no competition, bing? i've never liked it. duckduckgo? not reliable enough. never tried yandex desu, and i also never realized how many search engines are out there

google
bing
yahoo
duckduckgo

427,yes,"if we are talking early internet google didn’t even exist yet and we were using yahoo, webcrawler, lycos, etc"
428,no,"in a few years, perhaps even now, researchers will begin deep-indexing all video content online and cataloging exactly what's being discussed. this will form the basis of the search engine that'll blow google out of the water, to the point where we wondered how we even used google at all, much like we can't fathom using ask jeeves or lycos. 

you'll be able to search ""massacre in french nightclub"" and it won't search headlines or metadata uploaded by msm shills, but it'll search 100 million hours of visual and audio content, spit out a graph network showing the event in the center and all nodes that have discussed it, and provide a machine-learning summary of what the event was and who was involved. better still, you can just type ""muslim terror attack"" and get a map of all primary video content actually showing the attacks, then nodes on the periphery discussing it. 

this will bury the old web, which we're currently suffering in without knowing it."
429,yes,"what you just said was always the intent of centralizing platforms. by covertly supporting google, facebook, amazon, twitter ect they have only a few sites they need to comp and then they control the narrative.
they always knew most people are too lazy to look beyond the first page of google, so they funded google until it blew past yahoo and lycos and altavista and excite and all the other old search engines
now they have a nearly defacto monopoly on information
like the ministry of truth in 1984
those who control history, control the past, by rewriting the past, the future could be shaped according to the will"
430,yes,"my main consumer facing one is bing, because side by side the results are far more accurate and less sold out than google. it just isn't quite as good of a web crawler, but being less sold out overcomes that. sometimes for things that have been zogged i search on lycos, funny enough it still runs. duckduckgo is okay, lot of censorship there too. fun thing with bing is you get free xbox live (or whatever else from ms). i had like 80k points from searching and it costs like 6k for a month of xbox gold. so basically free xbox live for using their search engine."
431,yes,"so after google dies will yahoo be back on top?
or will it be lycos? or excite?
perhaps even jeeves?"
432,yes,"magellan, lycos, webcrawler or hotbot"
433,yes,"people definitely moved to google then. moving from lycos, hotbot, altavista was easy and actually refreshing."
434,no,"what ever happened:

lycos
webcrawler
askjeeves"
435,yes,"protip: don't use bookmarks, keep them on notepad, i started doing this after chrome keeps fucking with my bookmarks before i stopped using chrome. it's on your notepads, they can't change it

...and if you don't know how to fix your own laptop and maybe even if you do, keep sensitive stuff on an encrypted flashdrive, that way when you get your laptop to fix or to sell your personal data shouldn't be on it, unless there is cache?"
436,yes,"i've coined it ""social consolidation.""
late 90s/early 00s will be referred to as oldnet
everything else will be referred to as nunet.

spacing for readability and organization.

oldnet you had a to make a website. it wasn't hard. it could be. i remember learning html myself in 7th grade using my dad's college text books. most hosting sites had easy builder options. this was eliminated by social media.

oldnet had forums. if you wanted to talk a out something you had to find a site with a forum for it. and they were slow. like, checking back in 2 days slow. nunet has reddit, so whatever you want to talk about has the same environment and same rules.

oldnet had p2p clients for music and movies. newnet has streaming services and spotify.

oldnet had a barrage of video websites. tons of then. some worked shitty and some just worked alright. nunet has youtube. again; all in one place, same set of rules.

oldnet had websites. web sites. there was a .com for practically everything. there was a barrage of places to go and discover. i remember being in middle school and just typing in [randomthings].com to see if there was a website named it. nunet contains domains of businesses.

oldnet had precursors to social consolidation, but there were options. yahoo. excite. lycos. each with their own email domains, chat rooms, games, articles. nunet has gmail and no more all in one, do it all here kind if sires anymore.

switching directions here, search engines finally got good. but now, deep in the nunet, if it doesn't exist on the first page of results of google, it doesn't exist. not even that, if it's not spoon fed above the results of the google search, it doesn't exist. normies thunk since they type in ""covid vax side effects,"" into google and doesn't appear in bold before all the websites telling you where to go to get the vax, it doesn't exist.

i often wonder how differently the world would be if google actually worked how a search engine should."
437,no,"bitch, i birthed the internet. 
i watched a local bbs with 8 lines merge with another one county over.
i watched that bbs link get picked up by compuserve.
i watched compuserve merge with aol.
i watched 2400-9600-14400-28000 happen.

i watched gopher turn into hotbot, lycos, and askjeeves. 
i watched newsgroups blossom into http forums like whirlpool, then evolve into fark.

i watched the birth of 4chan.

motherfucker i was there for the birth of the internet. 
you can fuck off my lawn, i won't miss shit."
438,yes,"maybe i didn't pay attention to stupid shit that google or excel could solve. granted, in 1998-2002, i was using lycos and hotbot before gradually transitioning to google. either way, seems like wasted effort except for me getting the answer wrong means we nuke the commies. which is always a win."
439,yes,"we used physical maps to navigate, unfolding them was a pain in the ass
before texting we had aol instant messenger and you had to be at a stationary computer
people went out and socialized more instead of handing over their privacy to megacorporations like facebook
google was a shitty search engine competing with a bunch of others such as yahoo, dogpile, lycos, askjeeves, etc.
there was generally more competition, the over reliance on smartphones gave rise to big tech"
440,yes,"duckduckgo is awesome too, it takes all their search related results from google and resells their data to an israelic company. this is a great way for our economy and we should support them more. google is good, see.

as of speaking about the good search engines and all the doings behind the scene, let us not forget those evil ones we shouldn't use.
lycos is evil, do not use lycos.

love google."
441,yes,"so what search engine should we use?
google is globohomo, bing is bloated, duckduckgo is mediocre and lycos is dead."
442,yes,"i’m sorry but not sorry. google is objectively horrible for search now. you have to scroll past 2 pages of paid results before you have a 20% chance of finding what you searched for. back in the early 2000’s you could find anything on google. 

who altavista, search, lycos, ask era web searcher?"
443,yes,duckduckgo appears to have compromised search results. people have recommended me yacy and metager if i am not mistaken. i do not know what about lycos.
444,yes,"it comes from the name of their barbaric traditional haircut

does no one ever use google anymore? back in my day when we had a question we'd type it into lycos, altavista or askjeeves."
445,yes,">go to dogpile/lycos
>literally same google results full of listicles

the thing with the game is: you get 10,000 tech points to spend in the campaign and want to make sure you can get all you want unlocked. the complete tech tree requries 14,220 points to unlock everything. the campaign itself gives you no indicator at all how many points in total can be earned and whether you'll be able to unlock everything or have to make choices, which is the case. also found an outdated version that has different costs for certain unlocks from another patch version, so not listing that one."

searching always took skill effort time. nothing's really changed except now many people think they are being informed while the exact opposite is taking place. at least when it was tv normies still knew it was a boob tube, an idiot box, they seem to lack self awareness about the tranny maker in their pocket they lean on so heavily these days.

satya nadella, became ceo of microsoft in 2014. next year, windows 10 was released and double downed on everything the windows user base had criticized about 8 and 8.1, telemetry exploded in this release.

pajeets have been slowly destroying all record of the fun internet of old and removing all that we enjoyed about it during their march toward total erasure by ""web 3.0."" lycos, the company that owned angelfire and tripod, was sold to an indian company, ybrant digital, in 2010. archives of these classic sites were purged once this company took over.

yahoo!, owner of geocities, kept the service alive in japan until 2019 (as well as the classic yahoo! search, yahoo! images and yahoo! videos). guru gowrappan took over as ceo of yahoo! the prior year and served until 2021. most geocities archives, including the japanese sites, have now been lost.

pajeets are parasites that are killing the internet and tech as a whole from the inside. total pajeet death."
464,yes,"it was truly magical.

the only people on the internet back then were high iq whites and asians at large corporations and universities.

there was no myspace, no facebook, no youtube. in the beginning, there wasn't even google.

but we had search. there was yahoo! and altavista, and askjeeves.

if you wanted an online presence, you created your own page on geocities or lycos or whatever free hosting provider.

before the web, there was still internet... email, newsgroups, irc, gopher sites, ftp servers, etc.

it all kept getting steadily worse from about 2006 onwards."
465,yes,"i first realized they were being unfairly well when i searched the internet for why they smelled like they do and no search engine would acknowledge the problem. google, yahoo, ask jeeves, lycos, aol, all of them said i was making it up."
466,yes,">google, yahoo, ask jeeves, lycos, aol
those are all (((western))) companies. try yandex, the most based search engine of all."
467,yes,"there was no google. there was one browser called mosaic which was supplanted by netscape navigator and if you wanted to find something you had to use a consortium of search engines like magellan, altavista, excite, lycos, infoseek, and yahoo."
468,yes,"and not, it's ridiculous to ask me for sources, you can use google or baidu and you'll find tons of them.
there's even instances that happened within the last 5 years."
469,no,"only boomers; npc liberals; people who love science!™; news actors; celebrities ®; actual scientists and anyone else who has to pretend, believes the apollo landings were real. 
everyone else thinks it's bullshit.

there's still no 3rd party proof. this would not be hard considering the the chinese mapped the entire moon in hd but didnt release the photos. 

now why would they do that???

interesting to find that chinese state school teach children the us faked the apollo landings. also interesting to find non english or western syndicated news websites describing how generally the chinese dont believe a word from the west.

we are most likely lied to, in the way we think north koreans are lied to. 

best case scenario we landed on the moon but faked the obviously fake footage, for other reasons. worst case scenario, it's all fake. 
remember what bill clinton wrote in his book, wondering if the moon landings were faked. now why would a man who had his cock sucked in the oval office write such a thing?

470,yes,"it's hilarious to observe.
how 20 years ago the journalists, academics, politicians... explained that the free circulation of information would naturally push idiotic ideas out of the way.

and they were right, except the idiotic ideas are theirs.
and now they squirm and whine about how too much free-flowing information is actually a bad thing.

i remember muh human-rights activist who pinched their nose when china wanted a censored version of google. how dared they prevent their own population from reading whatever they want!

how china will laugh when in 10 years google collapse and the same cucks ask for a modified version of baidu so that their western population cannot access evil ideas."
471,yes,"duckduckgo has become as bad as google. try 
https://gibiru.com
https://yandex com
https://baidu.com"
472,yes,"ddg is good as a torrent aggregator or general search engine for copyrighted material that got dmca'd off google, including small-fry porn sites uploading premium porn. however it is run by jews, so you can expect such tomfoolery when you want politically incorrect content. i would recommend yandex and baidu, which are russian and chinese respectively, and therefore have no vested interest in protecting our elites."

shilling or out of touch?"
474,yes,"last week you could search for /pol/ and it would come up first or second in the results. now:

google - no entry
bing - no entry
yahoo - no entry
fucking yandex of all places - no entry

the only search engine that registers /pol/ in a search for pol is baidu - for now. so explain it. 

to disappear from search results across those platforms simultaneously? it has to be site-led. it must be the result of activity from within 4chan management, no?

and what else happens while this is going on? a new flood of shillposters, each one posting in a confident and assertive tone, as if the tenor of this place was always anti-trump, anti-russia, pro-israel, pro-deep state. the latest anti-pol plan is in operation, do you see? cut off new visitors. stuff pol with shill threads that simply assert the place is different - they're not even trying to provoke, they just want to make it look different. shut off the air supply and choke it. 

you must have noticed. the timing? the biden impeachment shit to preempt and counter the fallout from barr's investigation of the deep state's fake russiagate. 

if the deep state is headed for a showdown, this place has to be curtailed. 
the only timing"
475,yes,"i think the significance that the op wanted us to see is that baidu (the chinese mainland version of google) is now the 4th biggest site in the world and almost three times as big as yandex, the russian google."

478,yes,"yandex basically has different filters on it so to speak due to the language differences.
so here is a list of some search engines to use.

it's nothing unusual.

btw zuckerberg and mail group owner yuri milner are both jews who seem to be friends. milner owns a house not far from zuckerberg in bay area."
481,yes,">yahoo seems to be throwing out random websites as search results

483,no,"nice 

these two stand out
http://archive.is/iwupb
bing liu's patents with chinese companies are wiped from the internet after his death

http://archive.is/zxrg0
a baidu (google) search of ""bing liu"" links to many short minute-long weibo videos that overlay the facts of his death with dark, dramatic instrumental music 

so his knowledge is likely not unique
his colleagues at the lab are openly working on the same project
killing him doesnt end the work

other scientists are exposing the obvious lab origin of the virus
he is not special here either 

ccp publicly executed him as a warning to all chinese researchers worldwide who dont perpetuate the ccp coverup of the virus

and this one is the likely mechanism of the murder suicide, very ccp

484,yes,"bing, yandex, bonjour, boingo, baidu exists
there's no monopoly
just your laziness to not use alternatives"
485,yes,"i'm just saying, with no external pressure from apps like telegram, vk, yandex (russian), tiktok, wechat, baidu (china), there's nothing that americans can choose to protest being censored by every company from paypal to cloudflare or being spied on by the us government to the point where they're arresting ""white nationalists"" for simply googling the wrong thing. even parler will kick you off for saying ""kike"" too much and duckduckgo doesn't disclose what they do with your search history."
486,yes,"yes. there are plenty of autonomous regions dedicated to these groups. why do you imitate confidence when you know jackshit?

>trust google more than people who have no jurisdiction over you

488,yes,"yandex is the russian google.
it's good for translating things to soviet languages, navigating in the region etc.

like baidu it should be banned here because they answer to hostile governments"
489,yes,"hello /g/.

google, ask, bing, yandex, startpage, yahoo, cuckcuckgo, spindarse, or baidu?"
490,yes,"duckduckgo is heavily censored
startpage is a proxy for google results

if you want non-kiked search results then use baidu (chinese) or yandex (russian)"
491,yes,"i didn't know that name, had to google it. we call them trapper hats.

this picture off google was cute doe

oops i meant yandex... oops i meant baidu"
492,yes,the redpill here is that china has its own globo-homo. ask yourself what is the difference between alibaba and amazon? baidu and google? there is none. ccp is also in denial about their control on those tech giants. it won't last too long.
493,no,"within china’s vast online gaming community, a new phenomenon has emerged that puts racial stereotypes in full view – lucky players are known as “europeans”, while unlucky players are referred to as “africans”.

494,yes,"the russosphere and sinosphere have their own social media

495,yes,"this seemed like a major happening but it wasn’t really talked about.
it reminds me, ezra cohen-watnick (trump/flynn loyalist) was put on some declassification committee. i forget exactly, you fags can duckduckgo it
stop using google/bing, they are just baidu at this point"
496,yes,"why can't they into internet?
usa has google, youtube, facebook, twitter, too many to mention
russia has yandex, vk, telegram

they are only big international entity without any kind of internet independence"
497,yes,">people start using duckduckgo or startpage.
no, they will use chinese brands (e.g. baidu) as most of the city dwellers already do."
498,yes,"try bing, or better yet yahoo.co.jp or baidu.com"
499,yes,"what the fuck
bing is 100% preteen kids
yandex is kids, guns, and govt documents
on baidu its little kids, a b2 bomber, and a car crash"
500,yes,"bing is bigger than baidu. microsoft was one of the first tech companies allowed in china. china was the only country where microsoft basically sold windoze for $5 a pop, chinese still pirated it anyway. microsoft didn’t try to sue anyone in china or raise a stink about it. microsoft regularly hands over search results to authorities in china without then even asking. yahoo “got in trouble” for a similar issue back in the day."
501,yes,">uses duckduckgoy instead of yandex, baidu, metager, searx, etc.
let me guess, you use protonmail too"
502,yes,"a chinese person would easily do that by trying to mimic the sounds of the foreign language they hear, and say it using the chinese sounds they know (characters, because each character is a syllable) to mimic whatever they hear.

if you're curious about this sort of thing you can plug and chug with an online language converter like google translate. be sure to turn on pinyin. here are some chinese websites they have similar functionality, not sure how well it will work outside china though:

503,yes,"a lot of russian channels are blocked isp side here in latvia to democratize local russians.

no, it is splitting along social platforms and cultural/civilization/corporation zones,

eurasian yandex
chinese baidu

banks, healthcare and insurance are fusing into megacorps that offer to complete take care of every aspect of your life. government are increasingly becoming irrelevant, handing over power to corporations and even ai."
504,yes,"google has a process of editting these somehow (like how they give you a 3d view but they also do it for 2d view), you need to turn off the cgi stuff and look at the raw pictures (if they still allow that). or you can compare to bing / baidu which do no processing. easiest place to compare to see how google manipulates is to look around the middle east, it is much more green than google shows."
505,yes,"it's not so much the google search engine.it's the google services such as gmail, doubleclick etc. you can block most of google's trackers if you set up your browser properly, but blocking them all is impossible. there are certain things you can still do however, but i'm not going to write them down here. 

but if you still need a search engine you can use alternatives such as yandex or baidu.
otherwise, just use bookmarks. there is nothing on the internet that is interesting enough to make the frequent use of a search engine a necessity."
506,yes,"if you have to ask, you don't know. you need to know maths - linear algebra, vector calculus, probability theory. 
then you need to learn how to code.

then you will finally learn that ai is actually a meme, and anything you or i can do will be worthless compared to what microsoft, google, baidu, tencent, facebook come up with.
your ai will probably be struggling to classify tweets as negative or positive."
507,yes,"back in the 200's the ""media bubble"" was identified as an emerging trend.
as it was now possible to reach only one group of people there was a lot of targeted advertising.
around 2015 some clever clogs learned that instead of targeting specific groups, you could push them apart.
suddenly peter could not see pauls facebook feed, didn't get the same advertisements as paul, didn't get the same movies on netflix.

the insidious nature of this problem, is that peter could not work out exactly what it was that he wasn't hearing.
he know that paul had a different facebook feed; but couldn't see how it was different. 
peter of course asks paul; but paul can only point on differences one by one.

if you search ""tienemen square on google images you get douzens of photos of a man and four tanks- it's a strange photo.
if you search the same on duckduckgo you get a souzen photos of a nice looking red building.
if you search on bing you get the red building
if you search on yandex you get the same red building
if you search on baidu? i can't because i don't speak mandarin.
i wonder what would happen if i searched for tienemen square in mandarin on all these engines?
would i get the four tanks or the red building?
what if i used a different device, or searched in a differnt place?
it's hard ot get to mongolia, i wonder what they see?"
508,yes,">yeah you can walk the streets at night in china, totally safely.
how about triads and similar mafias? do they still exist, and if they do how big are they (compared to both cartels and street gangs in your country)?
>chink really do need to up their building code standards.
are they still made of cardboard painted to look like concrete?
>take a taxi and get a ride on the high speed rail. that was a great way to see the country, and people were friendly.
that sounds nice. truth is that i have never used the metro or a rail since where i live isn't big enough to need them.

>4chan [...] is blocked
how gay. what happens if you try to access a blocked site? do you simply get a page telling you that the site is banned (like in some workplaces and public networks here), or does something ""more serious"" happen?
>younger people use a vpn
any vpn in particular that works there?
>wtf? haitians are invading the towns too? where you at?
>one of the cons is that baidu (chinese google) is shit because it has no real competition
i found a search engine made by huawei (petal) the other time, and judged it ""alright"" since it censored or changed less results than the big two (google and bing). i don't use it for regular searches because it sucks at understanding complex queries or anything in spanish.
nah, i just use the term ""nigger"" to describe anyone who acts like a piece of shit without regards for anything or anyone, independently of the race of the subhuman.

also almost feel bad about mexico city having worse conditions than china (i say almost because mc deserves to be nuked two times)."

514,yes,"well for example what i am conserned about is the abuse of reverse psychology. these kikes are not stupid they know half the herd is going to stop using google search engine for example. so these people guide the right wing herd into ""kosher aproved media"" one example of this is how the right will avoid google and instead use duckduckgo. duckduckgo is owned by jews and uses flat art. im just going to use yandex or baidu. it is obvious to me this kind of abuse of reverse psychology is being used against the right. they know you wont listen to left wing media so they prop up some kosher aproved right wing media. somthing like that."

here is joe rogan, with a jew, shilling against google, and instead shilling for duckduckgo, which is also owned by a jew named gabriel weinberg. duckduckgo also contains corporatist flat art.

you would look for porn using metacrawler or webcrawler

545,no,"this. 100%.
women had more personality, actual individual personality. and from what i've seen of modern social media addicts, women back then were way more intelligent, then again, we all were. 

we didn't have google, we didn't even have ask geeves or metacrawler, we had to commit everything to memory, and we got really good at it.

people had to converse to say anything, even if it was by a landline phone call, we had to develop interpersonal skills, and as a result, we developed finely refined personalities.

we knew how to stand up to each other. we knew how to read each other. the world was honest... as much as human nature can permit honesty. but even then, when we were being lied to, we knew. we could read each other and see through the deception.

nowadays, people seem to be really fucking gullible, narcissistic, adhd impaired, and ultimately, whores. they just can't quench that interpersonal attention need... because they're not actually conversing with each other in any meaningful way."
546,yes,"initially i used metacrawler when i got on the internet on and off when i had no pc with connection at the time, then google for almost two decades. two years ago i started to use duckduckgo since i noticed the results getting worse when it came to many topics especially those controversial political or otherwise. google still outperforms them when it comes to maps, information and indepth topics. just month ago i started to use yandex sometimes because yet again i notice that certain results are not appearing."
547,yes,"yes, pretty much this.
there are good videos so long as the subject isnt political. but with that said, you can't use youtube's in-house search engine without getting a bunch of bullshit prioritized mainstream and pozzed content in your search results.
> wat doo?
use something like duckduckgo to search for the video you want
""better form archery""
then you get your search results, click ""videos"" and scroll through the listings indexed by the search engine, not youtube itself.

now because bitchute has caved to pressure from the adl, certain search terms have been hidden when you use the in-house search engine (same for jewtube of course).
> how git a'round dis?

easy.
use duckduckgo, type the follow in the search bar to use a metacrawler to find the content within a specific video hosting site that might be pozzed:
> site:bitchute.com hitler was right

just an example above.
now if you want to find specific terms, like the specific video titled ""hitler was right, use quotation marks in the field, thus:
> site:bitchute.com ""hitler was right""

cool, eh?
this is how i find a ton of great videos that still remain on you tube yet are not indexed through the in-house search engine, which would otherwise pull up gay ass, inorganic (((promoted content))) that likely has three or four interruptions by advertisements which only depict black people and *only* show whites when they are either inferior or subordinate to blacks.

so, lessons learned:
> do not use the in house search functions for jewtube or any of these sites.
> use something that isnt chrome or safari (i like brave and vivaldi :d
> dont use google to search
> use duckduckgo or something similar which doesn't rely on google for indexing results.
> search the topic you want
> click ""videos""
> voila!

for more specific searches, use the fun pseudo hacker commands ""site:"" followed by the website you would like to hunt for whatever specific terms

549,yes,"myspace is still going as well. 
yahoo was people's main homepage once the internet started catching on. then you would vary search results by trying alta vista and ask jeeves, metacrawler."
550,yes,"google has become beyond useless. monetization over time has really fucked up relevant results over time. it’s a compounded issue. imagine going to webmd and searching for “pain inside my ear” and getting pages and pages of articles about general pain medication with the word “ear” in it, hearing aids, that sort of thing. search engines like duckduckgo are starting to gain enough traction that they’re advertising pretty aggressively, so maybe the market is finally opening up. many years ago you could use multiple search engines like askjeeves, metacrawler, and it was considered normal behavior to use multiple engines. hopefully we’re slowly working our way back to that."

555,yes,"1. fight google to stay on google. government appeal, writing your congressman or appropriate office. chairman of the fcc? ajit pai to complain? https://twitter.com/ajitpaifcc 


roger stone advises: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybe_9a8-ik 

is youtube a public utility? should it be regulated by government? should the free market fix by offering a solution? will the crony capitalist cartel laden atmosphere allow for true free market? 

2. free market will decide. if your not already, boycott all google sites. so use qwant.com and duckduckgo.com for searches and for videos break.com , vimeo.com, and bitchute.com are some alternatives sites but they are small potatoes compared to youtube.

the one to be the most excited about: https://about.d.tube/ this site is supposed to be crypto currency friendly, against central control, safer, and less likely to be corrupt. will this be a good new alternative? lets hope!

557,yes,"bing just isn't popular and really doesn't give a fuck as far as censorship yet like google does. i still don't use it much, been using qwant."
558,yes,"duckduckgo is pozzed, startpage and qwant are fine though."
559,yes,"they claim to not track data. same for qwant. it's possible they do, you just have to go by their word. we know for sure that google does though. your best bet for privacy is to use the guys who claim to not track.

hell, i even use bing sometimes. believe it or not, bing has actually gotten very good. their image search is actually much better than google's, imo. i'd rather support microsoft as a competitor to google if i need better search results.


obviously not, and the search quality isn't as good, but it's fast. what you can do is remove google as your default search engine. replace it with something else. if you need better search results for certain queries that qwant or duck duck go just aren't working for, have google as a bookmark only. better yet, use bing. help another tech giant give those google fucks some competition."
560,yes,"this.
alternatives to google products:
google search - duckduckgo, qwant, startpage
google chrome - firefox and related browsers (i.e. palemoon, seamonkey), brave browser, comodo dragon. pic related is old but possibly useful to you, although i disagree with discounting browsers like brave and opera just because they look like they'll never become popular.
youtube - honestly this is probably the hardest to cut off for everyone, it's so ingrained into the internet at this point. sharing videos via webm is an option. you can download youtube videos into webm format using hooktube. for videos that are only on youtube (unfortunately, a lot), you can search for and watch them on duckduckgo for better privacy protection via youtube’s “youtube-nocookie” domain. in terms of serious alternatives: peertube, bitchute.
google maps - openstreetmap, maps.me
google drive - dropbox, mega
android - ubuntu touch, lineageos, sailfish os, plasma mobile

>bing, irrelevant corporate botnet ran by incredibly relevant and massive botnet
>qwant, funded by the eu
>startpage, literally just google with a paint job
>duckduckgo, suspect however source code is free software
given the options duckduckgo seems like the best option, ran through a vpn if possible
opera is a chinese botnet. there are literally no privacy browsers except links which isn't really usable on today's internet. realistically if you wanted total privacy you would need

>totally free linux distro like parabola
>links browser, should be able to browse sites though web interaction is limited
>avoidance of search engines
>proxy/vpn

it's basically impossible to totally obscure yourself from tracking on the internet, the best you can do is minimise what they have on you. something is better than nothing, running firefox is better than chrome, running ubuntu is better than windows, and using duckduckgo is better than google. there are no perfect alternatives and even fewer which offer similar levels of functionality so your best bet is to use what you can, when you can."

592,yes,"to truly understand, you'd have to go through a search on qwant, startpage or yandex. i've seen a lot from both sides on this and tend to lean on the side of the jews did it in order to take the important texts and documents to be spirited away to be held in what is now known as the vatican.

only use yandex, naver, or yahoo japan, their internet isn't filtered and it opens up much more results"

612,yes,"based (wish i wasn't a poorfag)

yes but you also get tracked by russkies. though i guess i'd rather get tracked by people from a country i don't live in. i use qwant which i feel gives way better results than duckduckgo. and when that doesn't work, i use startpage.

aside from 4chan, i don't really use google for anything, not even for emails! i don't even use youtube, i use hooktube."
613,yes,"startpage is good for searching for images. ddg and qwant use yahoo and bing searches, so that's why their ability to find specific images isn't very good."
614,yes,"search the word ""coalfax"" in the following search engines and see if you can figure out with one is best. there is a point to this exercise and it is political.
google
startpage
bing
duck duck go
qwant
yandex"
615,yes,"qwant or startpage only for me for the last 3 years
duckduckgo before that...then i noticed weird seo bubbles. i'd avoid brave browser too, started off great, then started crashing everything about 1 month in."
616,yes,">using duckduckgo
>owned by a jew and still tracks you anyway
use startpage or qwant, don't fall for this duckduckgo kike bullshit"
617,yes,"duckduckgo

618,yes,"in every city there is a catholic young adult, as well as a newmann center.

usually on wednesdays they have get togethers and you litterally just show up, thats it.

there pretty friendly.

just type in on google/qwant/bing ""catholic young adult 'your city'"""
619,yes,"in brave you can switch search engines instantaneously by typing :d or :g or :s or :b in the url address bar, if you didn't know. startpage is super basic and noncucked. duckduckgo might get cucked by it at least doesn't track your profile in big data. bing is also good and there is qwant. idk about yahoo and ecosia"
620,yes,"searching for ""idiot"" on google, yandex, bing, duckduckgo, qwant, yahoo, startpage will always return fat, orange face of zognald drumpfowitz. no exception."
621,yes,"us search engine cucked google/bing/duckduckgo/qwant/whatever popular on unpopular one.
4chan is not your search engine also subject of your post is not politcal in anyway there is not even correlation here."

>duckduckgo it

some suspicious sources said places where unexpected earthquakes, explosions, blackouts... occurred correlate with this.

try yippy, qwant, yandex, startpage, bing... instead.

627,yes,">use duckduckgo
they share data with google. if you have to use google results use startpage at least but im sure theyre still sharing something. jump on the yandex and qwant train. takes some getting used to but its not google so its worth it. dissenter browser is very similar to brave and imo better. fuck firefox."
628,yes,"if you cared, you would be okay with
www.duckduckgo.com
or
https://www.qwant.com/
or
https://www.startpage.com/

i call my beliefs reality, it's part of every religion if i'm not mistaken."

630,yes,"hope you're really doing searches with startpage or qwant...even duckduckgo is pozzed now, i'm told."
631,yes,"also it seems an usual activity of jews, freemasons and other similar psychopaths and sociopaths given recent cases involving weinstein, ebay ceos and other threads discussing freemasons here.
also many references you can find in any decent search engine (qwant, startpage, yandex, ...)."
632,yes,"google, qwant and duckduckgo
""ns propaganda""
""nationalsozialistische propaganda""
""national socialist propaganda""
you get the point"
633,yes,">any recommendation?

swisscows or qwant

therighstuff doesn't show up in many places because they have disabled crawling. so no search engine will show any individual tds episode pages. 
the only thing google hasn't censored is the blog site which shows up."
634,yes,"any search engine that isn't jewgle or bing. qwant, yandex, startpage, maybe yippy...
neocons are also former commies and a lot of them are jewish.
they always play all possible sides (and invented all sides)."
635,yes,"use a better search engine (yandex, qwant, ...), all of them are jewed but some are unusable (like google or bing)."
636,yes,"i use brave browser, i'd give it a try if i were you. feels a lot like chrome but is pro privacy and not shit like the others. 

as far as search engines, yeah you can't use google if its remotely political they will cook the results. and more and more everything is becoming political. so i use a combination of duckduckgo and google. 

google for gaming and porn. and duckduckgo for anything political. but people say duckduckgo is also compromised. there is also qwant and even bing seems less pozzed than the others."
637,yes,"just learn to search on google etc.

638,yes,"no they don't retard. google search is now ai based like bing. that's why nobody can seo anymore. they don't even have the iq to consent you sick fuck.

this is why i use duckduckgo and qwant"
639,yes,using jewgle when yandex qwant bing and duck duck go exist....why? google is the gay nightclub of the internet the only things you will find are gay and shitty
640,yes,jamie is the worst fucking fact checker and a stupid left cunt! he uses google that gd censors everything. either he knowingly sabotages searches or is a dumbass. i was doing a real time search using qwant & duckduckgo and was finding everything alex said with ease.
641,yes,"the french ""qwant"" search engine is even more cucked then google. don't ever use it, there are better options:

https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/e0f5a4d7-070d-4a03-aca4-3d898b5c5002"
642,yes,try yandex or qwant. not as good with relevant searches and working boolean as google 8 years ago but much better than current google.

648,yes,"google is the heart of the beast

google has always been vulnerable because 99% of their revenue comes from their search engine and they currently command over 90% of the search engine market.

collectively, if we moved our searches to other search engines like bing, qwant, or even yandex which is based in russia (their image search is really good btw), it would be catastrophic not just to google but also strike at the heart of silicon valley

remember, you are the product, if you stop using their ""free"" product, they lose their lifeline

honestly i get best results from bing oddly enough"

the captcha’s suck but you can get rid of google as a search engine. qwant and yandex are not bad. 
google is a very powerful organization that acts as a government contractor here in the us. amazon is the same except also a military contractor. whatever we can do to remove their attempts to centralize our data is a healthy step imo."

657,yes,"i'm really liking qwant as a search engine. i find that startpage and duckduckgo will have a strong leftist political bias, since they rely on google. i think qwant has their own algorithm, and i'm experiencing a lot less censorship.

is there a good overview written on data tracking in general, so i get get a good conceptual grasp on the topic and understand all the ways in which big tech violates privacy?

what is the consensus on brave?

are any extensions important to use in conjunction with ungoogled chromium?

is signal safe? i read that it was developed by the cia. is there a better alternative?

is there a good alternative to google maps?

is windows 10 safe to use? what's the best alternative?

i can tell you that the proportion of frontal lobe to adult body size impacts iq, which is not necessarily intelligence but composes aspects of what we call intelligence. intelligence is of course increasable, and determined people have been documented to raise their iq by 2 standard deviations.

you must have seen plenty of racial iq statistics here so i won't bore you with that.

lately i've been using search.brave.com which has very, very slightly better/less censored results, but i'm betting in 3-6 months it will be as bad as everything else (ddg was also quite good at the beginning and even gave me much better search results than google for a couple of months)."

as for browsers firefox, chromium(not google chrome) and brave are alright.
if you want better privacy then firefox with ""hardened firefox config"" and ungoogled chromium but they might break some websites since you're disabling some features that some websites might use.

708,yes,"duckduckgo seems to get their results from google. qwant is the way to go. i recently tried to find early (2013) footage of kenshi (a game). google just gave me recent kenshi videos which had ads on them. tried again with duckduckgo and the results were identical, video-by-video. i tried bing and yandex and didn't find anything. it was if the internet didn't exist pre-2019.
then i tried qwant and the first, third, fifth etc videos were exactly what i was looking for. footage of what kenshi looked like back in 2013. it was like back in the old days when you could actually find stuff. remember when you ran into some problem, did a search and found the perfect solution posted on some obscure forum somewhere by someone who had the exact same problem but found the solution? these days they just direct you to corporate sites that have ads on them, that just offer boiler-plate advice. it's like search engines are just gold-clicker games for advertisement companies."

711,yes,"yandex is on my 4ch thingy and it's a russian search engine without any of what they call 'globohomo influences'.
i find it useful due the sudden recent change of most western search engines prioritizing 'globohomo' commercialism, driving even wikipedia links to famous personages to the 2nd or even 3rd page. if you search something like ""black hole of calcutta"", you get 
>a row of indian ethot videos from social media

>2nd page a series of articles about a new comic book movie franchise featuring an pakistani superman
>3rd page of articles from vanity fair and nyt about the evils of colonialism
>4th page, bottom link is the wiki article
qwant is believe frenchy or some sort of other yuropoor search engine that lies somewhere between yandex and the tech giants. qwant will give you alternative european news, and many english-language newspaper links like le monde and other exotic papers that used to be in the newstand in my apartment lobby.
bing is no longer viable for even porn. it has always been the worst for politics.
google is straight up not even globohomo, but the results from a marketing committee at general electric, foxcorp, and advance media

>pro tip for yandex chads;

>you can watch literally any movie or show ever made on yandex from tons of based russian streaming sites, all you have to do is search :""movie name"" watch free: on yandex and you will always be able to find it somewhere. most of the sites have ads pop up when you click the video but that is to make thr site generate some money for the based russians who are hosting them illegally.

>i showed this to my boomer dad and hes absolutely ecstatic. google is pozzed and blocks all those streaming sites. you have 0 need for any subscription streaming services when you can use yandex.

-...
i've written extensive as well as extremely short feedback about single points, multiple times, on all named addresses with experience, explanation, reasons, ideas. not a single one of these fuckers ever bothered to answer, and i've done that for years with various e-mail addresses. that feedback goes right into the shredder, that much is for sure. it was so super frustrating watching things get worse and worse over the years. the censorship is the least of the issues. we're drowned in mediocre garbage and the search engines support that. even if there was the holy grail out there, the solution to everything, the search engines wouldn't let us find it but come with their shit tier features, like page ranking, resulting in always getting results for the same (((popular))) pages and terms, not allowing a new site with quality content to be listed within the first ten pages unless it's some globohomo corporation or some pushed fag. being forced to use garbage tier ""search engines"" (even the name is wrong: they don't actually search but censor, filter, use misdirecting terms instead of my provided search terms) is the only thing that gets me boiling mad with rage these days and it's a huge irresponsibility forcing billions of users daily into the same experience: not being able to look something up. try finding sources matching bitmap brothers game ""z"", for example, or the dos game ""m.a.x."" without naming anything but their actual title - so muuuch garbage just because a category filter ""game"" / ""video"" / ""review"" / ""technical issue (software)"" doesn't exist to filter out all the shit."

https://swprs.org/how-to-escape-google/

startpage is simply providing google search results.

duckduckgo, yahoo, qwant, ecosia, swisscows, metager and other search engines are primarily relying on microsoft bing.

in fact, there are currently only two real alternatives to google search - microsoft bing and russian yandex.

brave beta-launched brave search, using its own search index.

it's not exclusively google results, you can choose multiple search engines. click on preferences, engines and general. there's bing, qwant, startpage and others.

duckduck has always been shit"
748,yes,"although after just searching 8kun on startpage, brave search, and then qwant; qwant was the only one where it showed up as the top result. the others didn't even have it show."
749,yes,"i'd start exploring other search engine options besides duckduckgo, i'm not a fan of their hiring practices and despite being ""privacy-oriented"" they curate search results. could not get any utility out of yandex, but i recommend the brave search engine or qwant. 

the reason people are promoting brave is that the head of mozilla who did a lot of things right made brave after mozillx folx got angy about some donation he made. look into it and come to your own conclusion. it's not 100% there yet but getting there. the search engine is about as neutral as it gets (afaik) which is a plus for"
750,yes,"no, it's gotten pretty bad. look up the ownership, it's not a surprise. i use it as my normie-search engine since it still works for non controversial stuff. but everything else: qwant, brave search, yandex. there are a few more obscure ones but they get clunky."
751,yes,"redpill me on google /pol/. how come you all hate it? and call it goolag?

i use firefox instead of chrome and ecosia instead of google anyways, but i might switch. why shouldn't i?"

761,yes,"computer scientists here 
it’s quite impossible to be completely anonymous in the internet. but there are some tricks to make it harder to track you tho
use linux tails for an easy start, if you surf from your own computer, use tor browser 
if possible use public computers, in every library are computers 
don’t use services where you have to log in and verify and avoid all google services (at least at home)
regarding amazon, you could just avid online shopping. if you live in a larger german city you’ll get everything you need, and most shops even order stuff if you ask
if you still wanna order stuff, the deutsche post has packing stations (with deutsche post account) or postfächer (you get a number and it gets delivered to this). i don’t know if postfächer are still available anonymous but there were once

it’ll be never possible to be online and be completely anonymously, e.g. google can track you by your typing characteristics on any computer
but there are certain measures you can take to make it harder (e.g. use ecosia search instead of google, german company + privacy oriented + german and eu law) to track you
just be aware if someone like an intelligence agency wants to know something about you they’ll find out somehow"
762,yes,"i tried this one out, it seems to be very based. 
how is ecosia in regards to privacy? are there any jews behind it?

the very best seem to be swisscows, yandex and ecossia imo"
763,yes,"no idea about juden. ecosia is extremely small - you can see their annual reports, but the payrol is like < 1.5 million euro. if i had a single critique it would be that their re-forestation efforts are primarily the developing world (although that is what needs it most). they also have projects in spain and brazil though. 

i do not like yandex because of its coding and because i like to search for a lot of information about russia and i noticed a difference when doing so. 

>swisscows
ah yes, when i have children they will definitely use swisscows - excellent choice for ""safe"" searches."

775,yes,"all search engines are just bing or google. 
using google or bing results forces you into an exclusivity deal.
startpage for example is just google, while the mobile site is just bing due go licence agreements.
ecosia, ddg, quant, etc are just bing.
meta search engines that pull from both, plus yandex and small search indexes like gigablast and mojeek have all been shut down like ixquick when their lisences expired, or are actively blocked by google and bing like every independent searx client.
if ddg truly pulled from various sources, it would either only show results from gigablast, or 404 every time google adds it to the blocklist.
all commercial search engines competitors are just a facade or choise"
776,yes,"people use it, sometimes universities use it for their ""studies on extremism"" lol

otherwise, google has basically shot itself in the foot. they used to have a total monopoly on search, now i find myself using ecosia and yandex a lot, many use duckduckgo... this will probably only increase over time since google results are kind of useless for many topics, they just give you the shill sites for anything somewhat controversial, it's pretty paternalistic and insulting."
777,yes,"i use ecosia because google actually censors results on a lot of the topics i search. duckduckgo isn't ideal itself. yandex isn't ideal either, but image search on yandex is much better than google for political memes, or memes in general, because google censors that.

yes, 80 page papers get written about 4chan, where they count the ethnic slurs per hour posted here, and try to figure out when the most are posted, etc. it's kind of funny"
778,yes,"i use ecosia if i'm trying to find stuff censored by google. yandex works sometimes too, moreso for images or copyrighted stuff."
779,yes,"ddg is just bing ""wrapped"" in a series of proxies to hide your ip at the moment of searching, the actual results come from microsoft (and yandex to a much lower degree). other search engines that do the same thing are ecosia, yahoo and startpage (this one uses google).

>acts the same way as ddg when trying tge search mentioned by it's shit, and probably uses bing or google as a backend too."
780,yes,"iridium as a chrome/chromium replacement in general, waterfox as a firefox replacement for ""normal users"" and librewolf for ""advanced"" ones.

784,yes,"probably just sells all the data to google anyway. 
anyone use ecosia (via bing) for extra tree planting smugness?"
785,yes,"> ecosia's search results and search ads are powered by microsoft bing. we use bing's search technology, enhanced with ecosia's own algorithms. bing is microsoft's own search and it was launched in june 2009, so just a few months before ecosia was founded! but that's a different story. bing is the second largest search engine in the us, after google.

786,yes,"- mojeek.com

anything that is even tangentially related to 'wrongthink' is getting search suggestion banned, deranked or just straight up censored.
there are no exceptions, it happens on google, bing, yandex, duckduckgo, qwant, ecosia, etc.
>want to find a controversial video from a couple year ago? 
censored
>want to see an official document or report that is politically inconvenient?

>want to see an article from one of the approved 'real news outlets' which we currently don't want you to know about?

censored
>want info on any topic which might, under very specific circumstances, reflect poorly on us?
censored
>want to find pirated content?
censored, links you to a place where you can buy it
sometimes it will even give you articles about people getting arrested for internet piracy
>have a question about any topic, a technical issue, or want suggestions for doing this or that
here's 10 pages of seo-abusing webscraped bot-generated content that says the exact same (useless) thing

if you search something 'wrongthink'y enough they'll even serve you completely unrelated articles about 'disinformation', or in some cases try to threaten you by giving you unrelated ip localized results (as if to say 'i know where you live')
this shit is fucking ridiculous, you have to use multiple search modifiers in order to find anything
i've been reduced to searching fucking twitter to find old articles, but now they're search banning things on there too
how does one find any info nowadays?"
798,yes,"it's mainly google. while bing isn't exactly a great alternative, they do show more varied results. i use ecosia which is a combination of bing and ecosia's own index. at this point in time yandex is pretty much the search engine that was like the 00's (can you fucking believe it that a russian index engine is less censorious than western index engines). iirc brave is supposed to be building its own index engine now but it's still too new to be of any major use."
799,yes,"nah, google is way too censorious to find anything new these days. yandex isn't perffect but fuck me it's the closest to 00's google today. search engines are so bad that i mainly just put websites in my favourites because i know the search engines will for the most part take me straight to them. if i want to find something new i have to use brute force search tactics to out smart the algorithm's top search results. google search is proper dead to me, i use ecosia now and that i mainly use that as an image aggregate, finding brand new sites are a novelty because everyone has stopped using forums."
800,yes,"it isn't much better then google. duckduck has a partnership with microsoft. protip: if a company's ceo is a jew, they do not care about your privacy. just use brave/ecosia/yandex"
801,yes,"duckduckgo, bing, yahoo, mojeek, brave, swisscows, searx, startpage, qwant, metager, ecosia.

if you aren't using an alternative, it's because you can't be assed, not because they don't exist. personally, i use duckduckgo (want to use mojeek, but half of all searches are all fucked up and in different languages)."

805,yes,"no he’s reddit’s guy. ddg stopped hiring white men last year and censored rt this year. use something like ecosia or brave if you want more privacy than google, or just yandex if you don’t care about privacy"
806,yes,"i’m not sure, virtually all of them have their own indexes. startpage is just a self hosted google index without tracking, ecosia is just bing results, brave has their own index with some others mixed in but even they have to comply with us laws if needed. yandex may have the least censored results but it’s not private since it’s basically russian google"

808,yes,"ok i just tested this with ecosia [bing], yahoo, ddg, swisscows, qwant, searx, startpage, gibiru, one search, infinity search, and yandex. the winner? yandex by a wide margin. it delivered the most results and actually read the subject field of threads. second place is startpage. but..

remember that the only threads that are going to show up are the ones that those engines actually indexed, and threads don't stay up long enough to be indexed by anyone with any regularity at all. it's just a matter of luck and it's not comprehensive in any way whatsoever. granted, i did find some cool schizo threads that i'm gonna download, but it's no substitute for having the archive search functional.

this is fucking retarded."
811,yes,"searx, and as backups qwant or ecosia. and you are even better of using startpage(ixquick) even if they are owned by a ad company. but at least they are not owned by jews(for what i know) like cuckcuck and yandex."
812,yes,"startpage. mojeek. qwant. ekoru. (sometimes) ecosia. searx has problems.
unfortunately, there is not one search engine to solve them all, but that was how it was in the old days. accept this and its easier."
813,yes,"yandex has nigger multiple times in its source code iirc. there’s some suspicious stuff going on with the owners but until i see contrary information, yandex is by far the best one
anybody still saying ddg or ecosia or one of the other ten different reddit suggested alternatives is retarded. those are about as pozzed as google, i did some experiments a while back"
814,yes,">while there is millions of results
you can still find them with meta search engines. google's hasn't been wiped clean, they just gimped their results page. try finding one that uses its index but with a different algorithm, like ixquick.
bing, yandex, ddg, ixquick, ecosia, onesearch, brave, etc.
you'll always fall short with independent engines, since google has built the biggest index and it has the largest crawling capacity.
on the other hand, meta engines may use this huge index but usually have far shittier algorithms than the independent ones.
they got several lawsuits from stock image banks like shutterstock, so they intentionally gimped it. use yandex reverse image search for better results (and impressive machine learning capabilities, even better than what google used to have)."
815,yes,"exactly. and even if someone doesn't like google they could use duckduckgo, or ecosia, or startpage, etc."
816,yes,"fair enough, but startpage is dutch, ecosia is german, qwant is french, they all seem to have no problem figuring out what's right wing in english and suppressing it."
817,yes,"the results are worse and i am glad i am not alone.

add to your lists, some go down sometimes:
searx dot org

820,yes,">thos ""nanotech"" looks like salt crystals lol

prof. dr. burkhardt, a renowned and highly esteemed german pathologist, had a presentation where he and another german prof. of pathology, together with a prof. for risk analysis, definitely found various contaminants that ought not to be there, but since he passed away under mysterious circumstances in may last year, soon after he gave a presentation before an eu organisation where he casually mentioned his independence, the site https://pathologie-konferenz.info/en/ which hosted the pdfs now doesn't have any links anymore and search engine results are mostly just rubbish anyway, that being google, duckduckgo, quant, ecosia and so on are on full censorship mode even afterwards."
821,yes,">google this
no, i will search for it. you can’t google something. unless i can yahoo it, ask jeeves it, ecosia it, yandex it et al. little rant over, id prefer you show me. peer to peer communication is better than recommended jew search engine terms to ecosia."
822,yes,"can't wait to have one random post about the holocaust or the jews here on /pol/ to glow up and reach #1 on google, and billions of normies finding it by total accident, start reading, get based, and start building a world-wide reich in a matter of years and expel the jews from the fabric of reality itself.

825,yes,"duckduckgo is run by an israeli and has questionable privacy credentials. 

startpage was the private search engine of choice if i recall. i just use google regardless, it's really unmatched."
826,yes,"the most redpilled alternative is yacy: a open source, distributed search engine.
does not get more unbiased as when you control the bias.

that being said it is of lower quality compared to google.
another engine would be duckduckgo, but some dont like that it run by kikes.

finally: meta-search engines that search across multiple engines. that could help make the bias visible more easily."

so what it is /pol/? where is the truth?"
828,yes,"i think that's too much autism just to avoid being tracked by google and cucking advertising jews for your average guy here and there's probably full on guides for secuing yourself from scratch already made by better autists than me, i'm thinking more securing yourself with what you're already on, minor changes like switching browser and search engine
you seem to be competent but you haven't heard that duckduckgo was owned by a jew or his past ventures, that sort of shit i know /pol/ does care about, do you see what i mean by geared towards alt-right?

i could make part 2 or 3's, i think working my way backwards from the biggest issues to lesser but useful is a better idea, this is what i'm typing a draft for like i said to the canadian i'm trying to make it more of a ""things you can easily and should change without impacting your life or time too much"", shit like
>don't use duckduckgo it's owned by a jew and here's why, use ixquick/startpage which are anonymous google proxies and here's why they are the most trustworthy options
rather than a full on fresh install of linux with 100% open source software on a thinkpad x60"
829,yes,"it has terrible branding, and short of places already angry at google is has no reach.

i was considering this, taking a search engine like duckduckgo and figuring out a way to drive its usage up, but as it stands it is too ugly for normies to use. google has the feminine ""elegant"" look to its experience that people like nowadays. i think search engines should be focused on the ""packaging"" more than the actual searching, like how companies can sell anything as long as the package is pretty.

another thing is driving female traffic, women flocking to sites generally drives up the value since men follow and if women are doing it it is going to be palatable for most people. this would have to be an iterative process but these two points is how we could at least get into the ring with google."
830,yes,"here's a black pill for you.

and for you morons who are larping.

go to duckduckgo.com.

it is a search engine.

search ""img src""

turn off safe search.

go to images.

and realize how fucking common of a search term it is.

do the same experiment on yahoo.com.

the current, ""progressive"" popular big tech companies are hiding the sheer amount of these people.

google has more manpower.
they are better at hiding it.

but not removing it.

 ""out of sight, out of mind... but still there""

the big tech companies are leftists, pro islam, pro jewish and pro diversity.


the domains operate.
the pages work.
they are (((((updated))))))

companies who have ""taken measures"" are ((((hiding it)))))

they know the most popular search terms.

they know how often this is searched.

all.
they.
do.
is.
(((hide))).
it.

you faggots are babbling about mainstream politics and motives while this shit is going on under your goddamn noses.

keep larping.
pretend to know things.
pretend to share your ""red pills.""
keep making threads about your inane interests.

the rest of us are still trying.
where the fuck have you been?"
831,yes,"i'm getting nothing on yahoo as well. tried lower case and upper case both with filter off. literally yields zero results. works on google and duckduckgo though.

i'm guessing it has something to do with what country you're in."
832,yes,"its not a honeypot. yahoo/duckduckgo havent filtered out the results this shit was going on 10 years ago google had a lawsuit against them for it at some point i think. basically the less used search engines dont necessarily have to filter it legally but for fucks sake how are the webhosts still hosting those fucking sites and how in the fuck have yahoo/duckduckgo not came up with a way to blacklist those results?

this is the fucked up part. the reason why they show up when you search those keywords its because they are the most viewed results"
833,yes,"it shows by popularity
site:drive.google.com/file/d mp4
will get a bunch of movies, because those are the most popular mp4 files on google drive.
it shows pdf's because those are the most accessed files, for some reason. 
same as searching ""img src="" on duckduckgo or bing will get softcore kiddy porn shit, because most of the sicko's on those sites are searching for that. google manually filters it out, though.
filetype, so jpg, pdf, mp4, avi etc. 
older filetypes should get older content, so avi will be lots of old or 3rd world shit."
834,yes,boycott google. use either startpage (which is actually the same as google) or duckduckgo (not as good).
835,yes,"it goes far beyond that, though. suppose i have a small business and google decides to remove my business from its searches and maps. the bing and duckduckgo crowd isn't going to keep me afloat, i'd be fucked."
836,yes,"perfect! eat pig, get big!

>all you can up with is putting bacon on their books
what is google image search? what is startpage? what is duckduckgo?

i bet you converted to islam recently cause the natsoc larpers on kc weren't stupid and extreme enough. amirite, kuffar-kun?

837,yes,"sadly, it’s also jewish owned. i’m not a full blown nasi yet, but even i can see this fucking bait and switch tactics. it’s a shame, i remember a time when people used other search engines, like askjeeves and hotbot. it was kinda cool that there were good options and such. now it’s all google, with a small splash of yahoo, and bing. that’s it, otherwise it’s shit. my guess is in a decade, perhaps more we will be gloating about how duckduckgo is crumbling, and glorifying the upcoming “lillypad” engine."
838,yes,"delete youtube account if you dont use it to upload redpilled vids

839,yes,"stop using google

840,yes,"i had this same problem, so i switched to duckduckgo (proxy for bing that doesn't give microsoft your search queries). google is sorting ""credible"" sources to the top of their search results to ""fight fake news."""
841,yes,">duckduckgo
check to see who runs it
check to see what he did before he ran it
also, its a scraper for google, it does not have its own webcrawlers, so you're not really hurting google much, google is still being used to an extent (i think he mixed in some bing results)"
842,yes,"help fix my comprehension, tell me anon which one is preferable.

in pic related,
it shows that there is a innate list used by firefox known as 'tracking protection'. it uses a site which hosts an index called disconnect.me basic protection list. you can change this to use the disconnect.me strict protection list instead. 
differencebetween.com/difference-between-ixquick-and-vs-duckduckgo-and-vs-startpage/#cd

ixquick was the first to receive the european privacy seal (europrise) for its practices in privacy. this guarantees compliance with eu regulation on data privacy and security through technical and design audits. in the year 2009, ixquick completely ended user ip recording. in march 2016, ixquick was discontinued in the us. it officially merged with its own startpage search engine and users who enter ixquick will be redirected automatically to startpage.com. if the user does not prefer to use startpage.com the option is still available to use ixquick.eu. as ixquick.eu retain and runs in accordance with the european union privacy standard, it is preferred over ixquick.com and start page.

>european union privacy

i have a strong suspicion that the canadian privacy law is quite similar, considering we are in the british commonwealth, and sometimes can take their direction in legal precedent. 

does any based /techguy/ know then if i should just use the ixquick.eu as my default search engine. the other option is using ixquick.com, but it redirects to startpage. 

considering startpage uses the same google engine, it seems as though its inferior - as google has been known to delist /ourguys/ and other valid sites from being listed."
843,yes,"hey /pol/ why does searching up ""img.src"" or ""img.src!"" bring up nearly exclusively pictures of young, female children, often in swimming activities? it happens on google, bing, and duckduckgo for sure because i tried them. anyone know why?
the attached screenshot is just the beginning of it/"
844,yes,"
>google
>bing
>duckduckgo"
845,yes,"hmmm ask him about why the so democratic forces have conscripted civilians into their ranks

might want to read this aswell. search ""kurdish crimes"" in duckduckgo .com as it is less biased than googlag and bing
huh, haven't seen you in a while. i hope this is not a happening really."
846,yes,also look into search engines like ixquick.com or startpage to replace google. some people recommend duckduckgo but i am distrusting of it because it's made by the same scheming guy who made classmates.com and spammed the shit out of people and would require them to list 10 email addresses of their classmates to get full access to the site.
847,yes,"this. plus most english speakers are... white. it's like watching tumblr look at wage statistics and come to the conclusion employers pay them less for the same work.

brainlet logic. i don't even like google, i use startpage, duckduckgo, etc."
848,yes,"i type cats into google expecting to be able to search millions of pages but it stops at page 21. is my country behind some kind of 'watered down search' / wall?

see pic, please help anons i remember when you could search for days, i'd be on google page 719, and still get results, what happened? also duckduckgo is the same too.

how can a search term like 'cats' end on page 21??? why is google and duckduckgo limiting search result returns? i tired it on yahoo and it only returned 82 pages or 820 results
i remember when you could keep clicking page after page, you could be on say page 341 on cats and it would keep returning results. 

what kind of 'fuckery' is this now?

...and all my fucking results are for the same jew-owned-mainstream media outlets!!!!!!??!! it might as well just give me one result and have nsa approved reading on it."
849,yes,"there are other search engines that work well enough. duckduckgo, bing, yahoo search, etc.

>most people would be ok waiting 10 minutes for a video in exchange for no censorship
you're delusional. mobile users would not tolerate that level of bullshit."
850,yes,"i always use duckduckgo. search results are always american even with uk set as my location. prices are always in dollars etc. 
if i’m looking to buy something then i’ll just use bing. haven’t used google for a very long time."
851,yes,"you literally can't use google anymore to serach for this kind of shit, all the top results are fucking artificial fucking ""debunking"" bs article in which they fucking debunk only the most retarded joke theory about a certain subject to then call the entire subject itself ""debunked"", see pizzagate.

use bing or duckduckgo for real results."
852,yes,"google was always a propaganda machine.

if you want pure unfiltered search engines,then bing and duckduckgo is for you.
though do not in any under circumstances turn off safe mode
by being free of all filters,you get many illegal pictures shown up too."
853,yes,"keep bumping shill.

he had his wikipedia page deleted and locked out of it because his background is so impeccable they couldn't find anything to smear him with, so they literally had it shut down. google is censoring his search results and putting hit pieces on top. search him with bing or duckduckgo and compare the difference.

the psyop are the people trying to silence him."
854,yes,"but i heard that duckduckgo and startpage both use google's base, infrastructure what have you, so they're not safe either."
855,yes,"anon, this is made extremely obvious in each and every ""google doodle"". i remember the nasa one had one white guy, two white women, and four, or so, mud people in the doodle, whereas the group's achievements that were being referenced was made up of all white men, except for one asian man, and i believe one white woman. el goog will pozz things up any chance they get.

and bing is owned by microsoft, which was created by nigger-famine-preventer, bill gates. the real white man's search engine is duckduckgo."
856,yes,"
i've used numerous search engines. if you'd like i could screenshot and post every single result on every search engine. maybe duckduckgo, startpage, bing (lol great for (((porn))), and whatnot are all compromised. why not tell me the specific search engine that i should use to help me in the search?

or, how about you cockmongling faggots just post some fucking image macros that show the stats/studies with sources? stop being so fucking gay."
857,yes,"yes. to find studies, don't use google. they change the results to fit a pc narrative. use bing or duckduckgo because it's just whatever has the highest seo. and if i can't find anything, or want a quick summary, i usually google ""x topic"" + steve sailer, vdare, unz, amren. be careful not to stay in an echo chamber, but i trust these guys because they always cite their sources and link to official papers and such. here were some quick results:

858,yes,"i spent 3 hours last night looking for a porn clip i saw a while back

i tried so many keywords from what i remembered from the video's title. i searched pornmd, pornhub, google, all of the main tube sites. this took me an hour until i finally got a lead from a 5th page result on google. unfortunately the clip was much shorter than i hoped. but i had something to work with now.

i checked the comments and there were two anonymous users in the same predicment... they asked ""who this girl was"".

i desperately searched again. i was unsatisfied with the short clip that i had found. i tried to google every keyword term on the video.

""girlfriend morning wakeup brunette busty teen""

i tried every permutation of those keywords and nothing came up.

at this point, i have lost my erection and i'm doing it solely for the accomplishment. 

i tried to search again and again visiting pages of sketchy porn sites with the same sketchy ads. i thought i would try a different search engine.

i went to duckduckgo which surprisingly had less spammy results. i tried every keyword.

i scrolled all the way down. and out of a hunch i clicked an xvideos link ""girlfriend latina morning sex""

and surprise, it was the clip and the girl i had been looking for. i felt so happy. 

her name was conviniently tagged on the video. i went on another hour just watching what's available.

i searched for her social medias and found that she had none. (her name was nadine sage btw).

i finally decided on a clip. it was a sloppy facefuck vid. there she was, her innocent look, being completely destroyed by saliva. the idealization of this cute teen porn star was destroyed. she's just another cock loving whore after all. the orgasm i felt from cumminglasted for 10 seconds. i stated ut the window, reflecting on what i had just done.

this is the moment that truly changed my view about porn. a man cannot live a spiritually healthy and sound life and watch porn at the same time.

 i quit porn."
859,yes,"duckduckgo is shit nothing less juden about it then google, use startpage"
860,yes,"me neither. out of principle, i never buy anything directly from anyone like that. it's never a good idea to listen to someone with a vested interest in selling you something.

if you have to go to a physical place, do your research, go there, tell anyone even looking at you that you're ""just looking"" or ""no, thanks"" if they try to approach, grab your item and leave. i don't get why this is so hard for some people. salesmen are leeches, and you can feel the disingenuousness oozing out of them even before they say a single word or even look at you.

try bing, or duckduckgo. google's algorithms and resources are so refined and vast that no other search engine can really compete if you want to find anything other than porn."
861,yes,"possibly. did a search on google, nothing came up. searched on bing and saw this: https://www.open-public-records.com/court/district-of-columbia-468697.htm

had to add ""byrne vs clinton foundation rico court"" into the search to find it on duckduckgo."
862,yes,"hi, /pol/

it's probably /g/ related but what should i use instead of google and youtube? recently i started to notice that google is becoming more inaccrate and for me it seems that it's trying to 'push' me to certain sites. is bing or duckduckgo any better? is any of you experienced the same phenomenon? 

pic unrelated"
863,yes,"bing is terrible and duckduckgo is owned by people who previously sold user data to marketers.

if you must use a search engine, use startpage"
864,yes,wow using a search engine is now jewish? use duckduckgo startpage bing youtube? keep pulling at straws
865,yes,">""you reap what you sow"".
absolutely, the allies were riddled of backstabbing within themselves. what i didn't know and learned after reading the wiki on rhineland bastards, is that they were already a thing post ww1, so indeed they had it coming when americans got to france. not that any of this fills me with joy, mind you, unfortunately innocent people paid for the actions of their jewish rulers(and traitors) yet again.
something ironic is that when i searched for rhineland bastards on duckduckgo, it asked whether i wanted it to show censored results, which are usually nudity/porn. when i take down the filter i learn the only difference is that the search now displays the pic of a nigger in the wiki article. that was considered offensive."
866,yes,">>google is starting to censor 4chan


do yourself a favor and stop using google.

not to give microsoft props, but bing is a bit more open throated and alot of the google search operators work on bing. duckduckgo is ok, but still too limited on resources."

use bing - seriously

google is now censoring every ""non-official"" news source and labeling them as ""fake news""

search something controversial like:
why are jews pushing

868,yes,"stop spreading disinformation. duckduckgo doesn't use google search because google doesn't provide an api for their search engine. they use a combination of results from yahoo, bing, and wiipedia.

nothing."
869,yes,"amazon isn't just its own warehouses though. they distribute products but small businesses still have the opportunity to partner up with them as a distributor if they're the ones with that item. there's been a few times i've needed something specific and had to have it send out hich took a couple of weeks because it came from a small business somewhere.

i'm not a right-winger or left. i live by a healthy balance of both sides because that's just realistic. i don't want amazon to fuck off because it forces other people to try and come up with something better or to join them in some way because just like google, they're a giant monopoly of sorts even though we have duckduckgo and bing and yahoo."

toki is customisable, scrapes a lot of search engines etc, disable the ones you don't want in the options. mojeek is made in england and claims to be an independent search engine.
they aren't perfect, but they give slightly different and more accurate results than the others which are all kiked.
if anyone has any other true alternatives, that aren't based off google/bing then post them."
873,yes,"this page helped me out.
https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle

www.mojeek.com is perhaps the only real alternative to the main search engines (google, bing, yahoo), the rest are just piggybacking on the same two or three engines or are metasearches."
874,yes,"if you want a supposedly truly independent search engine, try mojeek. it's based in the uk, written from the ground up and is the only real alternative i can find to the big three.
another useful one is searx.info - there are a few sites of it as it is an open source meta search. go to preferences and select which engines you want it to use, it is pretty powerful if you play around with it.
deselect google and duckduckgo, and maybe bing, and then your results won't be so tainted with pages and pages of intentional filler/distractors."
875,yes,"yeah i spent a few years looking for real alternatives, found that almost every search engine there is now is a clone of google, bing, yahoo.
mojeek is pretty good, fewer results but it definitely feels like an old search engine, instead of filtered stuff.
searx is open source so you can even make your own server.
glad it's useful.
remember to minus out the common search terms and com sites etc, stripping out the stuff helps a lot. like searching for raw stuff with ""-corona -covid"" etc skips the propaganda and controlled opposition for that subject.
to infinity."
876,yes,"try mojeek search engine - and set your country to either 'all' or do it according to which results you want. it is the only truly indepedent search engine i've found in 5+ years of searching.

877,yes,"stop enabling the monopoly. explore some alternatives:

 fully independent search engine as it has its own web crawler and index. doesn't rely on indexes from big tech. gives unbiased results and strives to protect user privacy but it is based in the uk which is a five eyes country. uses 100% green servers if that is your thing. only downside is that the results can be sometimes be weak at times.

if it doesn't index it directly you know it's just trash that runs google or bing underneath.
it's fairly rare for an engine to actually index /pol/ so it's a great metric.

mojeek is one of the few ones i've found, by searching for /pol/, that is actually an independent search engine with it's own index.

906,yes,"there was a website that talked about how they control you, and you know it
where did it go does anybody have any links
here is some snippets i remember about the website:
> example #2
> you see a girl walking on the side walk with a dog
> now think do your self: ""am i a dog? do i bark? no, i don't bark, do i have four legs? no, i don't, do i have a dog? no i don't (if you do have a dog think to yourself): ""is that my dog? is my dog that color? no, then it is not my problem it is her problem""

it also recommended to view the matrix and the truman show on top of the website

i need it to get red pilled about the jews, as my os broke and i had to replace it
or is there atleast any other websites to get red pilled about those who want to control you?

it also talked about survivals and how they try ro make you believe the hurricane wasen't real

tried to search for it on diffrent search engines(googe, duckduckgo, qwant, mojeek) but couldn't find it
can guys help me? or lead me to other?"
907,yes,try brave (it’s alright and seems least jewed) or mojeek or bing and maybe google as a last resort.
908,yes,"mojeek, gigablast, search.marginalia.nu, wiby. for image search, you're stuck with yandex."
909,yes,"fuck bing i moved on immediately.
try mojeek for searches and yandex for wank videos.
or just go to /gif/"
910,yes,"yes, it also works with mojeek. mojeek doesn't manipulate results with an algorithm (google, bing, etc) when searching for jew related shit."

915,yes,"what happened, well it happened everything and nothing. you'll have to try to search anything what is of your interests with several search engines. google, bing and yandex (gby) have the biggest index of the websites and almost every other search engine relies on them. however, there are a few search engines which are totally independent from gby. i will put the link later. anyway, when you start to test several search engines with controversial searches and if you can't get the desired website in the first three results than that search engine is not worth your time. i used to had a pdf of many blacklisted words from google and youtube, but i'm sure you'll find those words with ease, after this reply. 

lets test search results with one controversial website which is blacklisted almost everywhere on the internet. i am talking about the old forum which goes under the name stormfront. here if you search for that word you ain't gonna be able to have a direct link to that ""controversial"" forum.

yandex, mojeek, alexandria and right dao is a winner here, the rest of them are unreliable. 

here is the list of the search engines i'm using:

>now 
nigger i cannot fathom you are still using google it's been shit for over half a decade now. 
yandex is the only major browser left that's decent. mojeek is good but too obscure and not super efficient."
919,yes,"spent a lot of years monitoring this.
in 2000, there were tons of separate search engines. in the late 90s, search engines had become less accurate and more corrupted by adverts and paid results, google arrived with a clean, plain format, no paid results.
once it eliminated the competition, it became more and more paid and less accurate.
about 15 years ago, google results started becoming less accurate, more interpretive. more was censored/directed.
10 years ago it was already heavily filtered, babified. searching for anything real delivered only restricted results.
8 years ago it spread to bing, with the same results more or less appearing on both.
i spent several years every now and again looking for real alternatives and found none. they were all based on yaboo/bing/google. eventually i found a version of searx that had been rebranded, then managed to find the real searx.
it was meta search, but you could choose which engines were being used, and eliminate the main - poisoned ones.
a while after that i found mojeek, which claims to be independent, designed from scratch, and the results are actually different. results however are low in number and it doesn't cover a lot of old stuff.
a lot of this filtering/diverting/censorship killed all the independent sites and forums. old visitors and user numbers dropped off, and since no one could find even heavily established sites, there were no new visitors, so they were shut down by their often one man teams.
i went to a site i'd first used 20 years before to find the guy who'd made and run it all that time saying he was closing it since his site wasn't searchable and no one was coming.
it was a really useful site and none have replaced it.
lots of those little hobby sites exist, but are unsearchable unless you are very very specific.
during coscam-19, censorship was piled on even more heavily, which meant medical documents were almost unfindable."
920,yes,"so, a lot of you already know- google and youtube kind of suck these days. for years i've looked for good alternatives.

finding alternatives to youtube was easier than for google. bitchute is great for the stuff that youtube likes to delete these days. conspiracy videos for the most part, which is what i loved about youtube anyways. if i'm looking for a more ""mainstream"" feel, i go to odysee.com or even rumble.com. but i feel that odysee and bitchute by themselves are good enough to replace youtube for me personally.

for google though...

duckduckgo is suggested a lot as an alternative to google but it sucks just as bad as google. same lame search results. 

so, i got lucky the other day and found the following website: https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/

i really want to spread the word about this website. so many of the search engines he shows that have their own search indexes are sooo much better than google for finding good information that's no so heavily propagandized by the mainstream media.

i've been using mojeek, right dao, and infotiger and love the results i'm getting. 

also, check out wiby.me to search websites that have the personal type of feel to them like how the web was in the early 2000s.

and one more. check out www.boardreader.com to search forums all over the internet.

google and youtube sucks and i want to know what you guys use for alternatives."
921,yes,"i noticed over a decade ago that search engines were being blinkered. i spent years looking for alternatives, with the main ones becoming more and more similar over time.
i found there were no real alternatives to bing/gugal/yahu - everything was just a reskin, and all three produced almost identical results, with bing being the last holdout for a while until it fell in line too.
the internet might exist, but there's no way to find it. it's just the same top 10-20 sites in almost every search, and search terms aren't even searched for - it just interprets what you might be searching for from their pre-made catalogue of forced 'choices', and delivers one of those.
with no search engine, you can't really find any alternative to anything, even if it exists. there's no wide open space now, just corridors they choose for you.
one i found which was semi useful was searx, a meta search where you can turn off engines - i.e. the big ones that give false results, but it isn't up to much.
then the last one which seems to have been made from the ground up is a small one called mojeek - but it gives very few results and is clearly incomplete. it does however pass the tests i set and spent years using."
922,yes,"kek
neither bing, yandex, google, brave or mojeek can or will find a connection
which is why i'd like to see if anyone has an old dictionary
google too can find what you found in your pic"
923,yes,"duckduckgo uses bing as source for it's results, and it basically became some kind of honeypot for the gov to see what people are looking for on a ""privacy focused"" search engine.

the only solution is mojeek: not hosted in the us (uk), doesn't use cookies nor store your ip, and has it's own unfiltered and unbiased web crawler."

927,yes,"thanks. 
i actually never bothered much with yahoo or bing search much because i automatically assumed they would be just as pozzed as google.
had better luck with mojeek, yandex, and searx.

total shame nothing seems to come close to google in its haydays."
928,yes,"
google, brave, and duckduckgo all hide controversial websites, both hate groups and piracy related ones. you need to use mojeek or yandex to find the good stuff, and they're not as good as google when it comes to accuracy.

most websites respect the dmca if they're based in the first world. the internet is actively censored for ip reasons."
929,yes,"there is no startpage without google, nob jockey. they use google for their results, but prevent tracking. you can make your own search engine with yacy, it's fun, but you might have to actually learn something instead of sitting on your fat ass letting corporations spoon feed you everything like a giant retarded baby."
930,yes,"duckduckgo is powered by bing. they also forward your identity and search details to their affiliates, which includes microsoft, amazon, and even google themselves. the creator made it big on his first project before ddg which collected users' address books. he then sold all of these contact details to a third party and made millions.

one alternative is fireball (fireball com), an anonymous german search engine that is fast and gives relevant results in a clean interface.

another, if you're more technically inclined, is yacy (yacy net), a peer-to-peer, fully-decentralized search engine that also gives incredibly accurate results. it's much harder to track and profile users performing searches on p2p projects like this. the one downside is that you need a client running in order for it to work."

938,yes,">ultimately how searching should be
yes and no. right now it's the best choice, but it assumes that we have all these big black-box-malicious-actor search engines as it depends on their search indices, and is built with the explicit goal of hiding the end user from their surveillance. in an ideal world we would not have the likes of google at all, so no search results for searx to leech off of, and no motive to escape the surveillance. the ultimate utopian endgame of searching the internet is yacy but it's very immature and needs more people."

problem is, there isn't enough users. if everyone on 4chan used this, it may actually become viable. the problem is that we are letting (((them))) have too much control and power by relying on google and bing."
957,yes,"yandex got canned similarly, only that their engine used to be so good you could literally find anything, now it's only at the level original google was at - which wasn't topdog by any means (but alright for a few things like art and antique i suppose). they literally had facial recognition tool. i remember using a random pick i took in italy and it literally gave me social media of people in picture

there are still resources, but thing is, they seldom are willing to work with private people. gotta be some form of company and even then i bet that govcucks and bigcorp have lobbyed these resources into excluding lone wolves. you can still technically get in on it by creating a company in name only, and only select few services that aren't really state of the art (on purpose).

they're filtering out normies out of web with these changes. the people who would learn dorking or use resources like yacy are a minority compared to clueless normies who don't even know simple commands like only allowing pdf files to be shown on kikegle etc.

i don't know how i feel about this. on one hand, filtering out normies into ai algorithms will create pockets of internet that will remind us of 90s to early 2000s era. on the other hand it's dead internet theory for those who don't know how to weather the storm."

itt we discuss the best alternatives to push for (it's also an investment opportunity i guess).

1. google
2. facebook
3. youtube
4. twitter

1. startpage?
2. gab?
3. dtube?
4. zappl?

do any of us have access to or ideas for some sort of analytics we could use to assess how much of the users of these platforms would find censorship objectionable?

whilst we're trying to begin the process of getting people to migrate what other options do we have to go after these companies? subsidiaries? shell companies? associated businesses? 

in terms of how behaviors in a network change over time we should go for the smallest and most influential communities first because that gives you the most momentum to start and i think we could get all of their networks to duplicate or switch their alternatives over 2 years. 

it's worth noting if you wanted to become an ""e-celeb"" or start something influential, you'll have a much easier chance at the moment if you're first in one of the new platforms.

they've packed their businesses to the gills with the worst sorts of people, can we know bring their whole enterprises crashing down on them? 

do we have that much power...?"
963,yes,">yep, you're an actual retard. you have no idea what goes into a search engine nor do you understand why startpage exists and how it is funded.

> a zogmerican company like infowars simply can not buy them and if you actually knew about the things you talk about you'd know why.

you haven't explained why and i've asked repeatedly. so care to explain wtf you are ranting about?

> in the event that they somehow got the okay from european officials and bypass the bylaws of the foundation and could muster the million and millions they'd have to put into it to just maintain it while making absolutely zero money with it

you don't have to buy startpage in specific you autistic retard, it was just an example of a search engine. as for spending money to buy a search engine, yes that's called an investment you dumb shit. if there was no money in owning a search engine companies like yahoo and google wouldn't exist.

> also, lmao at infowars being a huge company. if they were actually huge they would have done something else besides rely on jewtube for exposure a long time ago.

according to many estimates infowars is worth about $64 million. that's more than four times what it would take to buy/start a private search engine and integrate it with bitchute and gab under one banner asshole."

>you don't have to buy startpage in specific you autistic retard
then why are you crying about it when i said they can't nor can afford to fucking buy it.

>as for spending money to buy a search engine, yes that's called an investment
yeah let's buy this search engine that doesn't make any money but actually costs us millions every month to run it and we will increase our snakeoil sales at least 15% by the 3rd quarter

> if there was no money in owning a search engine companies like yahoo and google wouldn't exist.
they operate on a whole another philosophy than startpage. good luck for alex jones trying to compete with them, a guy whose whole fucking business got dealt a deathblow by jewgle just cutting him off from that sweet jewtube advert money.

>according to many estimates infowars is worth about $64 million.
that's not a huge company at all, and you have no idea how company evaluations work when you think it means they have 64 million dollars of liquid cash to spurge around for investments.

> integrate it with bitchute and gab under one banner asshole.
and these are also free and are maintained by good will and fairy dust, just like search engines just werk without having to employ people to run it. just duct tape the whole thing together for free and you have billion dollar platform where he can sell his magic boner pills. seriously are you fucking 12 years old or just that retarded?"

this week, we've seen 4 major tech entities conspire against one single broadcasting company. all at once and in one clean sweep, they removed it from the internet. the very fact that this also happened just 3 months before the mid-term elections, shows clear signs of political collusion. in light of these recent events, i present to you the following course of action: 

>trash your ipad and all apple related products. never buy them again. 
>trash your smartphone and get a normal flip phone instead.
>delete your google, youtube and facebook accounts. all of it.
>stop using gmail, and get a decent paid email service such as startmail; it doesn't collect data and lets you encrypts mails, create aliases and temporary adresses.

974,yes,"telling someone to ""google it"" is the most asinine method of research and only demonstrates that the person telling you to ""google it"" is as scatter brained as their methods and discredits what they have said. not to mention that is borders of proselytizing for a company product that smacks of the greasy used car salesman. some people do not use google for the internet queries and telling someone to ""google it"" is akin to telling someone to ""buy a honda"" ""use sony"" ""shop at ikea""
we would not be appreciative of this advice in any other context, but for some reason we all accept that ""googling"" is the universal product form for internet query, knowing full well there is startpage, ixquick, duckduckgo, bing, yahoo, dogpile, etc."

gina haspel: it's good to see there is something you are shy about/ashamed off. said with a smile, i could hear the smile.

it was because one of the whores across the street thought i was impotent, so i showed her a nice erection, then later on when one of those incels attacks happened i used startpage to search for it instead of google, and the cia do not want me to use google but had been trying to get me to use startpage, because google shares my information with journalists. she said it in such a voice that it was obvious someone had shared the video of me showing a nice full erection in my room.

977,yes,"so does, bing, startpage, and most other major search engines.
i can't find relevant information like i used to. everything is being scrubbed from the internet.
i typed ""i hate mark cuban"" in quotation marks and couldn't find any relevant results. i know i'm not the only one who hates that arrogant liberal faggot but any results with that phrase seemed to be scrubbed from major search engines, especially google."
978,yes,there is startpage but that's mostly an anonymous version of google. bing is the same shit but with micro$oft.
979,yes,"bing video & image search is superior to googles

and duckduckgo is certainly run by a data selling jew
seriously go try bing video search vs googles, especially with porn
we must support bing"
980,yes,i typed it into google. i fucking knew. but still. i switched to startpage and if duckduckgo wasn't owned by a jew i would be using it. i can't use bing because microsoft is still evil. we really do need a new search engine platform. i'd like to see a mix of dmoz and search and much more filtering options. for example. i looked for a power washer the other and every fucking site out there had links inside taking me to walmart or amazon. it was like they were all fake stores. i would love to block out sites that have links to amazon and walmart so i can actually find other products in the marketplace. same for news. i would love to block all the msm websites completely. if i never see a new york time article again or cnn video it will be too fucking soon. so get on it /pol/ and i will be a very happy user.
981,yes,"disabling third party cookies is probably the easiest way to throw a wrench into companies tracking you. that and installing ublock origin.

if you want to go further, don't use any google service logged in, and if you do have to log in, quarantine it to a private window.

also a good idea to regularly clear out your cookies as sites do build profiles on you even if you're not logged in

duckduckgo and startpage are good privacy friendly alternatives to google search, and if you're not getting the results you're looking for bing's results are usually quite good"
982,yes,"stop using (((google))) as your dns and/or search engine. switch your dns to 1.1.1.1 (opendns), duckduckgo/startpage for search engine, and chromium/waterfox for browser.
also take a look at privacy badger and ghostery."

use startpage instead of google or even duckduckgo since it's run by another jew. use dissenter as a browser instead of the shitty chrome, firefox, or opera and their branches and offshoots. use protonmail for email, and use bitchute instead of jewtube.

999,yes,"how come bing image search shows few 'holocaust tattoos' with letters though? they all seem to be six digits except two : a-2623 and a-25060 which seems too well done ( it has an actual font ) startpage(google) shows no lettered tattoos. duckduckgo shows some with letters.

but most have only numbers and never seven digits. lettered tats would be likely to be the majority. if they switched to them then you'd expect latecomers to the camps to have better survival rates than ones who spent the whole time in the camps.

or maybe those ones were well established ( it not being a death camp ) and were able to do well for themselves at the expense of the 'fresh fish' as conditions deteriorated.

did jews stay in camps with nonjews? did the tribe beat up on the homos and jehovas and gypsies?"
1000,yes,"yandex is relatively decent actually, and ive found many pages with yandex that were otherwise blocked by google. you're choosing kgb over globohomo, but since the former has much less of an interest in you and less interest in twisting search results than the latter, its a net win.

ddg and startpage do also have some bypassing of googles filters - eg if you look for free movie sites, you wont find most of them anymore via google whereas ddg/sp will still bring them up (123movies, etc)"
1001,yes,"duck duck go isn't as great for your privacy as they claim to be (startpage is a lot better on that front). however, both startpage and ddg have been absolute shit for me since the recent news about google influencing elections. the results for both have been absolutely absurd since then. don't know why. think i might give yandex a shot."
1002,yes,"just look them up anon, stop using google though, they are evil, track everything and are pro-censorship. use startpage.com or swisscows.ch"

1007,yes,"what do you use? i bet it is the data seller/collector known as duckduckgo, which like other ""search engines"" is not a real search engine, but rather scrapes and aggregates bing and google results
duckduckgo has no website crawlers of its own topkek
what a scam
same with muh startpage
the only real search engines are bing, google, and yahoo, excluding some tiny ones
ill say this, google uses algorithms for those search results
no human sets them
it is trained by endless leftist bots and leftists until it links trump to all these keywords 
they do it for the fuck of it, as a joke
i hate google as the next /pol/fag
but this shit is not manually set by a human, it is trained and uses keywords on websites to try to get relevant results"
1008,yes,"ddg gets most of its links from bing. the advantage is everyone gets the same results. if you want to get google results, but also 'anonymised' then you can use startpage, a dutch firm. they get most of their links from google. you can also search ddg with a g! in front of your search term. that will pass your query from ddg to google and back to you without google applying their modifications based on your ip or login data. there is not much else you can use i'm afraid. yandex is ok, but limited results."

>how we made search private
>you can’t beat google when it comes to online search. so we’re paying them to use their brilliant search results in order to remove all trackers and logs."
1016,yes,"duckduckgo's owner gabriel weinberg had a startup prior to ddg with which he made pretty good money selling people's data, including phone numbers. also ddg claims to not log your ip or your search history, but despite this they have personalised ads.


startpage is a good one. it will give you results from google but it's effectively a proxy. whenever you search for images or websites, you can choose to open it with anonymous view so that you do not have to connect to the site itself to view it. instead startpage will just download the contents (except shit like javascript) and reconstruct the page.

without steam not if they're steam store games, but without the steam client, someone was working on an alternative client:
https://github.com/scholtzm/punk/issues/34

if you know anyone with nodejs experience, this project is an alternative to the bloated and laggy steam client, i found about it a few days ago only and looks promising, it cannot run games but it's possible to add this functionality if there is enough support for it. i only know a bit of js and cpp otherwise i would've helped a bit."
1018,yes,"5. be very reluctant to compromise on javascript, flash and java. disable them all by default. if a site requires any of these, visit somewhere else. enable scripting only as a last resort, only temporarily, and only to the minimum extent necessary to gain functionality of a web site that you have no alternative for.

6. viciously drop cookies and local data that sites send you. neither the tor browser button nor tails do this well enough for my tastes; consider using an addon such as self-destructing cookies to keep your cookies to a minimum. of zero.

7. your workstation must be a laptop; it must be portable enough to be carried with you and quickly disposed of or destroyed.

8. don't use google to search the internet. a good alternative is startpage; this is the default search engine for tor browser button, tails, and whonix. another is duckduckgo which also has a hidden service. plus it won't call you malicious or ask you to fill out captchas."

1029,yes,"it's not real. searched on bing and startpage (trough vpn) for this article and found nothing. 
i'm starting to think that it's some data mining operation when op posts screen of some ridiculous article without providing link so you're forced to google it. then google looks up search requests in given time, find your requests coming from your ip and you're marked."
1030,yes,"of course i have understoof for a long time that google ""sucks"", but i have only just realized that was a surface level understanding.
sure i have understood that google is evil and that is why they removed their tag line of ""dont be evil""
of course i knew they are left wing/neo liberal biased cunts, who did their best to help clinton and manipulate political search results.
i know they track everything and try to know more about you than you know about yourself.

i thought i was being clever using startpage. i was feeling as smug as a liberal. ""i get the results without the tracking""
but just now i had to use a livecd os that had another search engine set to default. i made a non political boring search, and the results, just for this everyday ordinary stuff, were way more relevant. this is from a search engine that i didnt even use in the 90s during the pre-google days because it sucked so hard. and it is now better than google. just been testing other non-startpage, non-duckduckgo search engines, they are fucking better than google just for ordinary stuff. i am fucking blown away. i feel like i have just discovered something i subconciously knew for years but couldnt quite put my finger on it.
when did google stop giving a shit about giving relevant results even about non-political stuff. google is now like a shitty 90s search engine. amazing.
i have been testing other search engines like yandex, even bing and yahoo, and they are fucking better! i feel like i have rediscovered the web."
1031,yes,"google has specialized queries and a larger data pool, but that's about all it has going for it. between the captcha bullshit and manipulated results, it's a second-rate search engine these days.

isnt startpage just google results? and duckduckgo gets a substantial amount of its content from google too right?"
1033,yes,">when did google stop giving a shit about giving relevant results
it started becoming shittier as more and more % of the users became smartphone users, i.e. retards.

1037,yes,"shadow banning became a thing in about 2010. before that time, websites with information that could harm plans at the top, where just destroyed. i lost a lot of websites that way.

to hack shadow banning by google, i figured i could do that with my blog, by copy and past every article in a new blog account, post it there, than 2 month's later do it again. i would bypass shadow banning in the past by using a forum account, instead of a blog account, than blog there with several personalities. that website did well for a while in search, but is has become hard now to find hostings that will give free forum accounts.

i worked a company once for a short while, where i had to bring websites in top search results at search engines results. at that time, only porn was censored, but since trump won, all politics that isn't politically correct gets shadow banned.

today was looking for images for an image to make in gimp, all images i found in search where form before 2017. search results become worse through the years, but google was already the best search engine in the 1990's, it's hard to compete. duckduckgo uses the google index, so the shadow bans also work on there, as with other meta search engines like startpage."
1038,yes,"
the other part of the handwritten letter claimed that maye was into african witchcraft, which is plausible given she moved to south africa (age 2-3) and lived there for many years of her youth. the mention of maye’s connection to charles manson and the manson crime family in the letter is something i was unable to verify with my short and limited research for this video. it is interesting to note however, that there are literally no results on google, bing, startpage and the rest, that actually contains the keyphrases “maye musk” or “maye haldeman” and “charles manson.” this could mean that there really is nothing there, or, it might be a purposeful “white washing” of any information that can be found on the topic online. 

the letter goes on to state that kaye haldeman not only visited charles manson at one point in prison, becoming popular with the crime family by providing tv’s and other luxuries, but that she also conceived elon’s sister tosca at some point during her visits as well. these claims are impossible for me to verify."

1042,yes,"i did a phrase search just to see what all the engines would come up with. believe it or not i think it was alex jones. and bing has the best resualts by far. ddg, startpage were almost identical copies of google. yandex did ok as well. if you want to test it yourself, just think of a concept you know the kikes will be manipulating. for example search white couples in google images then black couples. you will see what i mean. then try this in bing. maybe their image search will be better to. i haven't tested it yet. if you have any search you feel might be controlled by google, then test it against the other engines. i think bing will come out on top every time."
1043,yes,"anons have done it before

>they call him a meth-head to make him seem unhinged for not backing down to them
>baked exposes that andy warski literally does coke though, they use every deceitful tactic to try denying this but ultimately admit it’s true because baked is honest and they are not
>baked is normal the entire time dropping banter but didn’t give them a trigger warning
>bloodsprout faggots get so emotional they literally want to murder baked on stream, tough guy tonka sounds like he’s on the verge of tears

1053,no,">deadly force might be the first resort. no. wrong answer.

>even self-respecting 4-legged predators know perfectly well how to double-team their prey.
respect is an alien concept to animals. also, predators murder their prey. also also pack hunters die all the time attempting to take down dangerous prey... they utilize every unfair advantage in their arsenal to dogpile on the weakest and most vulnerable. also also also predators are the attackers, no animal in nature will subdue an assailant and not kill the fuck out of it.

>justice is served in a court of law - not through the barrel of a gun.
self defense isn't about dispensing justice. it's survial. you should not go around stabbing people, that isn't justice either.

1055,yes,"this is googles fault. they srarted the trend of penolizing your search resaults for having recipercating links. before google this is how you teamed up with simular sites to boost your rankings on the major search engines loke msn,yahoo,dogpile,aol and various other seo's"
1056,no,"downright asking people to leave is a good way to not even get a comment since you're trying to tell me why i come here. if having no problems with any identity and holding individuals to the merit of their own actions makes me a racist, wow, guess you're right, i do come here for radically different reasons than enjoying a likeless, upvoteless, dogpile free short of bait and idiocy. guess i should go to the other chan that has no traffic and incites violence/statistics taken out of context. here i can gwt a tap on what's going on and it's part of why i watch msm too, to see what's holding attention while things like iran or sanctions get no attention despite gas prices climbing back up because of it."
1057,yes,"excellent. i've been sharing this with other people i know. i tried to search for the scythian one on google but they're blocking it. same with bing. 
searched on dogpile and bingo first result. go figure an ancient search engine works the balls now."
1058,yes,"i was being because i am a man

old school searching with proper operators and modifiers was way fucking better once you learned how to craft a query. now google straight up ignores commands it once accepted.

i used excite back in the day and way back dogpile, hotbot, altavista. yahoo got really good for awhile as google began rising. i will say i miss the chatrooms that were once so common on sites likenyahoo and excite. good shit all gone for normietech now"
1059,yes,"in practice, most americans pretty much trust the ones they claim to trust least the most, and the ones they claim to trust most the least. few will distrust google sooner than they'll distrust bing, or dogpile, or any smaller search engine that may exist. few trust the military or police either. they're probably only honest about trusting churches."
1060,yes,"it almost doesn't matter what engine is used anymore. yandex is pozzed, dogpile is rarely better, so there's that, and then duckduckgo is secretly google. yeah."
1061,yes,"dogpile searches many engines at once. sadly, most of them are controlled like google, but it's still better.
and the person who said bing is good is an idiot. they are google2."
1062,yes,"did you know there is a thing called google
or yahoo
or bing
or dogpile
or duckduckgreyduck
stay mad because you're dumb though"
1063,yes,"back in the day, i used ask jeeves and dogpile almost exclusive. then i went to ixquick, and they merged with startpage, and it's my home page now. someone asked about it and firefox playing well together, and i don't have any issues. i do with ie and startpage, starting a little over a week ago. i don't use ie often enough to be assed to go in the settings and figure out wtf is wrong with it though. usually if i'm going to ie it's because i'm going somewhere else, and while startpage is trying to load, i go wherever i'm on my way to, and forget about it....."
1064,yes,"***************** how to improve opsec physically (computer systems, security and networks) *****************

ok so while i won't explain each of these methods in detail, i'll list the method of protection along with what it does:

a network level vpn (router level) - runs all network traffic through a vpn meaning that you can't be identified by ip address, important against being identified by the police more than anything. (socks5 aswell as this is good)
>nordvpn and proton are pozed. same ceo for both companies and somehting about payments going to luthiania
>take the sentinel pill, blockchain based vpn
http://www.sentinel.co

if you got spare pc or laptop. isolate your shitposting ""computer or connection"" from your main computer - nothing done on one computer can be linked to anything done on the other computer.

secure your computer systems use custom firewalls and security solutions to ensure that the regular malware infested tools that you'll find won't work.

use fde or full disk encryption - to stop forensic teams from being able to inspect your computers and link activities to you.

harden your chosen operating system settings and security - (you'll have to (((google))) or quant/swisscows.ch/yandex(if you're fine with fsb) how to harden your specific operating system). stop using mac and windows or any google products. 
>take the linux pill
>alt mobile os like ubuntu touch and lineageos

use a proxy within the browser - always (this is to give the impression of you being an average user and to make sure that even if the vpn fails you can't log into any shady sites without some level of protection.

harden your browser - to reduce the attack vectors that hackers, skids and law enforcement would use to identify you.
>firefox pozed
>(((chrome)))
>cuckcuckgo fucked now too"

1.1 change default search engine to yandex or https://swisscows.ch/ as suggested by bong bro on other thread. i personally prefer yandex because it is out of us and nsa spying and basically better than google. 
2. learn how to change dns on your router. that's right! not on your os or your browser, but on your router. i will not spoonfeed you but i will give you this link - https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html 
3. you can choose to use adguard's dns, which blocks ads by default and is also russian or you can choose to use other encrypted dns servers. here are some of the lists - https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/ -- https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/ -- or you can use nextdns.io to configure the filters yourself. it is basically free but the owners are jews. so think for yourself. 
4. change your dns on your os. yeah, i liked, you need to do this just to be sure. windows, mac, android etc have their different methods to do it so use your favorite search engine to learn how to.
4.4 after fixing your dns check if it's leaking your isp's dns by going here https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ 
here are some extra features: 
5. install violentmonkey extension 
6. install 4chanx

come on guys. google's motto was ""don't be evil"" and look where that got them. now you believe some other corporation else values privacy just because they say so? because they happen to be smaller?

1070,yes,"https://swisscows.com/

swisscows has the best actual results.

google is so obviously pozzed that's its effectively useless for finding anything relevant other than directions, tech support, or anything else you used to use the yellow pages for. 

swisscows just gives you the info you ask for"
1071,yes,"i like gigablast for results most mainstream ones don't return, google is getting worse even without the censorship, swisscows is ok too"
1072,yes,"i used swisscows for a while, then they started putting 3+ ads at the top of every search plus coming up with some shit about not being able to find any results for stuff that even google would show.
i have no idea who owns yandex so take that as you will, but it has had the least censored search results in my experience."
1073,yes,"i use swisscows. 
its not as slick and the results aren't always the best it ain't pozzed like jewgle or ddgo.
i liked yandex but it frequently asks to solve captcha's so fuck them."
1074,yes,"swisscows, yandex or bing, in that order, if you need to search for unpopular things you need to use stuff like gigablast"
1075,yes,"no, it's shit, gigablast for uncensored results, followed by yandex, swisscows used to be good but like google don't show 4chan.org"
1076,yes,"yeah same, google for normie shit/shopping, bing for normal use and images, swisscows and gigablast for politically incorrect/sensitive information"
1077,yes,"ddg is israeli trash, start page is just google, i use searx, swisscows and yandex."

yandex/swisscows for general info
gigablast for anything sensitive or political"
1079,yes,"i use google (chrome), but for some reason my searches will show up as bing results occasionally. henrik palmgren mentioned swisscows search engine, but i usually only use that when i need to find dissident results and (((google))) is clearly censoring top results or images, etc."
1080,yes,anon on biz posted his job results with them. he changed his name to like shaniqua and they hired him. fuck cuckcuckgo. i just use google because at least i can save images properly. saving sucksuckho images forces you to name it or its just duckduckgo.jpg. i heard swisscows was private though it was new so search results were wild.
1081,yes,"google is fucking shit. absolute toss. i cannot believe anyone still uses it. it's ok for tech searches, but even they are chock full of adverts.
swisscows - great, but small database
yandex - some censorship, esp relating to russia
searx - never got on with it, but friends like it"
1082,yes,how does swisscows compare? i remember one article that google and duckduckgo had buried on some famous israeli military commander giving an interview saying israel would lose the next war and explaining why i was able to find #1 on my search on swisscows and couldnt find at all on google with the exact same extremely specific search terms
1083,yes,"lol no, never was even bing is better, google is only good for shopping
try swisscows or gigablast for info"
1084,yes,">swisscows or gigablast
wow never heard those before. tried startpage, brave and searx too, i think startpage is the best. yandex is the best for reverse image search but it's tapped directly by fsb kek."

- google
- bing (used by duckduckgo, brave search)

1108,no,"
here are some arguments:
your first source of 'evidence':
1. link to a tweet of tom scott, one which has been followed up by the brave team and fixed. the project is new and you can't do everything right in one go, but they fix critique and that is just so conveniently not included. pic related. this is over 2 years ago.

2. the other argument is about how you need to kyc to withdraw your bat, which is due to law restrictions. opting into the bat rewards program is completely your own choice - you don't have to - so this is a complete non-argument.

your second source of 'evidence': 
1. they identify auto-updates as evidence that it's spyware... completely lacking any foundation whatsoever. in fact, forcing auto-updates on your users might prevent them from never updating and running into security risks.

2. ""google is default"" - you get the option to choose during setup. besides, brave is working on their own privacy-aimed search engine called ""brave search"" which will from that point on out become the default selected.

3. telemetry setting is unchecked during setup and transparantly asked for.

4. the rest is just a bunch of nonsense about requests the browser makes without showing any sensitive data in payloads etc.

so as i said: a lot of fud nonsense."
1109,yes,"you might have already seen some shills talking about ""brave search engine"". 
the new boy in town that ""doesn't use google search indexing unlike duckduckgo""!
it's totally different!!"
1110,yes,"yeah, i'm using brave search right now and it's better than google or ddg, but if i want to find something globohomo is sliding it's usually easier on yandex."
1111,yes,"reminder that duckduckgo is owner by a jew, and therefore cannot be trusted. ideally, use searx, though brave search may be safe, given it's christian owned."
1112,yes,"anyways, this is a start, but the *real* differences are hard to find, at least on google. try duckduckgo, brave search... anything else, really
https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-sars-cov-2-variants/"
1113,yes,"which?
how do you set yandex in english?
yandex.com redirects to yandex.ru
it's been a few months since https://invidious.xyz/ page returns 502 bad gateway for me 
>brave search
doesn't brave rely on google and duck?
explain"
1114,yes,">bing, yandex, brave search, ddg
all not using googles index"
1115,yes,"i can't even use google, it doesn't find anything!
yeah, yandex is like google twelve years ago.
brave search is also good."
1116,yes,"there were 3 videos. in one, a journalist asked about the location of the camps that were being build in quebec. he was told the locations were classified.
in another video, someone recorded a camp in the process of being built.
in a 3rd video, someone asked in parliement(?) about the camps and the mic was shut down halfway and he was skipped.
you will not be able to find any of these without looking on page 15 of brave search nowadays since they shut it down hardcore. one day it was the front page of google if you looked for it, the very next day dube said it was a conspiracy theory and it was wiped out from existence."
1117,yes,i couldn't get used to duckduckgo and don't use it but brave search clicked just fine. haven't used google in over a month.
1118,yes,"metager, startpage, brave search. last one's in beta and still borrows some results from google, but it's good."
1119,yes,">googled
learn to use search browsers, instead. yandex, brave search, (to a much lesser extent, duckduckgo) and some others don't curate their content before displaying. google hasn't been a useful search engine in a decade."
1120,yes,"you do know that both of these are proxies for bing and google respectively, right? sure they hide your ip, but you're still using a pozzed search engine.

use brave search, that actually has an independent index and the devs have a really good track record after making the browser on the market"
1121,yes,"ddg sucks but for search results, its no worse than jewgle. in fact it sometimes finds shit that jewgle has clearly downranked. 
use a mix of startpage, ddg and yandex to find your results. brave is shit dude, worst censorship ive seen in a search engine. and thats me admitting jewgle and bing are trash becz they censor results. 
i was genuinely hopefuly for the brave search, but jesus their censorship of results are ridiculously extreme"
1122,yes,"duckduckgo's search results are atrocious.

i've been using brave search for the past few months (they apparently rip off bing results) and it's much more livable. if you need to use a google search instead, just do ""!g search query"" bang, just as in ddg."

1124,yes,"startpage is ok 
brave search sucks 
yandex is a bad idea"
1125,yes,"yandex, startpage, searx, and brave search don't seem completely shaped by the pozzed google algorithm that renders any remotely political results 99.8% lugenpresse trash. ducksuckgo has always been crap due to just being a google skin."
1126,yes,"google is evil

duckduckgo is now woke:

brave search is our last hope"
1127,yes,use brave with the brave search engine. yandex is just russian google
1128,yes,"for top tier schizos everything is bad, you should go innawoods
sane response would be no.
also, brave search is only non-globohomo search engine, everything else is based on google or bing, or you have russian or chink propaganda, which is the same shit"
1129,yes,">using google in 2021
many alternatives. brave search, duckduckgo, searx etc."
1130,yes,"also, i'm using brave search, i've heard good things about bing, google is pozzed as shit, they only blast propaganda for like the first 3 pages, it's nuts. web3 tech like grt will change this, but it will take a little bit."
1131,yes,brave browser is legit. i've been using it for years on desktop and mobile. the brave search engine is getting better every day. duckduckgo donates to leftist ngos. for email use protonmail but keep your old gmails and just let them go dormant. two years after deleting my google account i'm still finding accounts that use it as my password reset email. very annoying.
1132,yes,"don't use safari, apple collects your data. use either firefox or brave. and don't use google use duckduckgo or brave search as google censors results. search jews control on google and go to images you will get no results. search jews control the media on duckduckgo and go to images and you will get tons of information."
1133,yes,">using chrome and google in 2022
get brave and use brave search of searx."
1134,yes,"argue about something they dont know anything about and heres their programming:
1. search on google(not any search engine like yandex or duckducko or brave search but specifically google and you can see them using the verb to google not to search the internet) 
2. open first wikipedia article about it and skim past over it 
3. return with bullshit they read on wiki as if it was the ultimate unquestionable truth of the universe about the topic"
1135,yes,great browser. i use bing for search as it feels like google from 15 years ago. it's okay. brave search needs work still. once it's good i'll switch to that.
1136,yes,">duckduckgo or brave search

anon if you think using these over google makes any difference youre already beyond saving."
1137,yes,"brave search is ok, bing is actually way better than google. not sure if bing is doing the same shit ddg is."
1138,yes,"brave search is it's own search engine and not just reposting bing or google.

brave so far seems to be the most ""mainstream"" alternative that isn't pozzed. yet. inevitable it'll be sold or infiltrated. though maybe the founder learned from his mistakes after getting kicked from mozila by trannies."
1139,yes,"i'm using brave search now

i've also heard good things about searx and yandex"
1140,yes,"ddg / brave search but everytime you use it, you just end it with !g, !b, !gi or !y depending on where you want to actually search (google, bing, google images or yandex respectively)."
1141,yes,">switch to brave search
i try to but it's really bad.
been switching between bing and yandex lately."
1142,yes,"so since duckduckgo is some kike shit that is not censoring results and brave search is just as bad as google for results. for my browser i use firefox with arkenfox user.js, what search engine should i use now?"
1143,yes,"yandex, brave search, or, if you want to nerd out, you can host your own searx instance."
1144,yes,"searxng with startpage and brave search

here's a public instance list if you don't want to self-host:
https://searx.space/
just pick anything that's above version 2022.. searx (non ng) is a lot worse imo"
1145,yes,"i use brave search and it's surprisingly great. it's got a similar feel to google which i actually like for practical reasons, regardless of how gay and corrupt they are as a company. every other search browser i've tried such as duckduckgo always felt awkward and gay."
1146,yes,"yandex, searx, brave search(beta)"
1147,yes,fuck ddg and fuck google. brave search and searx.
1148,yes,searx or brave search. startpage if i'm desperate.
1149,yes,"it's a russian based search engine that says it's privacy based.
it could be. but i don't trust it 100%. nice search system though.
i personally usually use brave search from the brave browser.
i've heard startpage.com is a good search engine too because it uses all the google results but without the tracking.
i'll have to look into this. never heard of it though. i like brave a lot so far."
1150,yes,"so? yandex is shit, more than that, it is under fsb control, why would any sane person use it anyway? ddg, startpage and brave search are much better."
1151,yes,">brave search engine is being controlled by leftists
it's probably rebranded google or bing."
1152,yes,"if you can help it, consider using a different search engine.
-good tier-
searx -> https://searx.space/
startpage -> https://www.startpage.com/
presearch -> https://presearch.org/

- has problems, but better than google -
brave search -> https://search.brave.com/ (great privacy, but results are kind of skewed towards leftist propaganda)
bing -> https://www.bing.com/ (microsoft is still globalist)
duckduckgo -> https://duckduckgo.com/ (recently implemented promoting propaganda, search results may be skewed)
yandex -> https://yandex.com/ (not the best privacy)"
1153,yes,">social engineering
an unbiased search engine is not social engineering, its freedom of information, google, duck duck go, bing, even fucking brave search engines, they are social engineering."
1154,yes,"yes -- brave search. 

the engine was created from scratch (duckduckgo uses the bing index) by brendan eich, the inventor of javascript and former ceo of firefox that got cancelled for political donations against california gay marriage.

it's not quite as refined as other engines, but it's also the only one not curating results for political objectives.

https://search.brave.com/"
1155,yes,"startpage is owned by an ad company. ddg is cancer. the least bad option is yandex or even brave search unfortunately. people need to realize the cocept of ""search engines"" is already dead. i think we should all go back to curated lists of cool websites like in the early internet."
1156,yes,"brave search is basically a google wrapper. i find bing to be useful sometimes. yandex finds stuff better than google though in my experience, especially censored search terms."
1157,yes,"duckduckgo was always zogged, it's founder is a jew that got rich by scrapping emails and userdata off the internet.

i'm on brave search and yandex for images and anything that brave isn't good for."
1158,yes,"i have tried yandex, searx, and brave search and all of them are shit. what is a good replacement for duckduckgo?"
1159,yes,brave search is a gimped version of google at the moment. hopefully the search index will be expanded further in the future: yandex is currently the only good search engine.
1160,yes,"i literally copy and pasted than in google and nothing came up, and also in the brave search engine.
i just asked for a fucking link retard."
1161,yes,"i'll give that a try thanks, i'm using brave search and it's been treating me well

yeah don't use google it's censored i've been using brave search personally and i get uncensored results. even fucking bing has more results than google lol."
1162,yes,"spbp. 

so, what search engines are you all using? startpage? brave search? i've been using public searx instances, using the libredirect extension. some don't return good results, or are hosted by cloudflare, so i just disable those ones.

1164,yes,"yes, they support censoring misinformation about the russia ukraine war and recentely got into trouble for not blocking microsoft trackers in their application. this alone is enough. the owner also used to sell data about people's information: like one of those people searching sites. the engine uses bing so censorship is invetiable, can't fault them for that. but they don't actively use their own crawler even though it could have been trained to be good with it's popularity. i would recommend brave search or hosting your own searx instance. yandex is russian spyware, just like how tiktok is chinese spyware avoid it."
1165,yes,"imagine using duckduckgo. once they started censoring russia links i switched. 

use brave search or searx"
1166,yes,"google search has declined.
unfortunately bing gives back shitty results when searching in non-english languages. i'm currently trying brave search (i don't know who's dara they use...) which is decent, but gives back only few results"
1167,yes,"none.
google = utterly pozzed and filtered, unusable in any capacity if you want unbiased results
bing = less pozzed but still aids riddled, only slightly better
ddg = useless and betrayed its userbase (oy vey!)
yandex = good for torrents, piracy, and alternative/dissenting opinion from google, but still biased, just moscow leaning, also results may appear in russian
yahoo! = no difference from bing
brave search = still in test phase, not sure yet"
1168,yes,">imagine using google, use bing/yandex
i use google and yandex. says a lot when i trust them more than microsoft. bing and ddg also have the worst search results. i don't trust qwant. ecola or whatever sucks and is just bing in greta mode. searx is unusable when even with just 1 search engine selected it shows less/worse/no results than using that engine directly. brave search can be okay but it uses my geolocation for results. google just werks most of the time and when it doesn't yandex is good. yandex is also good for image translation and reverse image search.

there is still not a single search engine that doesn't fuck up image searching ""white couple"""
1169,yes,"use yandex, it is much better at getting results. i ditched duckduckgo and tried moving to brave search engine, but that shit sucks. yandex is the only alternative so far that actually searches for what i type in.
fuck jannies btw"
1170,yes,its been that for a couple years now. i don't use google it. also no cuckcuckgo. brave search and yandex.
1171,yes,"google, bing, duckduckgo, brave search, etc are all fake. the all promise millions or billions of search results, but run out after a few dozen pages of results. they're obviously heavily filtered, contrived and curated. i want a search engine that will give me bob's random blog in addition to the mainstream results. i don't mind the mainstream results being at the top, but sometimes i'm looking for alternative views. none of the major search engines do, they just want to shove .edu's and msm down my throat and pretend like the rest of the internet doesn't exist."
1172,yes,"bing is still pretty good
then yandex
brave search has been very disappointing so far but i do have high hopes for it"
1173,yes,"i use google only when it's about coding. it is the only thing it is still good for.

i use brave search for day-to-day tasks and looking up things - but its just slightly better than google, it still prefers and actively advertises mass-media and wikipedia.
i just accepted the fact that search engines aren't as good anymore as they used to be.

yandex for image search and things i know all the glowy engines are biased in.

political things and news i get via rss. i started using an rss reader again and set it up with all the interesting blogs and news sites i want."
1174,yes,"brave search is still rough, but keeps getting better. it isn't very good at long queries — especially where you want it to answer a question like how google answers questions but it is improving. the filters are still new and imo underutilized. some of them are poorly made or half baked little projects, but others are pretty good. 
i think there is still a lot of tinkering to do with what works well for the filters.

also brave is one of the few search engines that doesn't rely on bing/google, although they use bings images and i believe video they have their own index for search results. they've talked about potentially adding their own images to the search results because they have a ton indexed but i think are not quite ready yet."
1175,yes,not true. i can't speak for yandex but brave search will only do that if it can't find any results. it also informs you that's what it's doing and still gives you the option to refine your search some other way (rephrase it) rather than speaking to google.
1176,yes,"it's common knowledge to historians of any merit. somehow, by random coincidence, all information about it got scrubbed from the instanets. curiously.

for those interested tho, there's tons of information about nato not moving eastwards. lets it be an exercise for the reader. pro-tip: use startpage/brave search/yandex. google/twitter/facebook are all a part of the syndicate of the us government, it's not a secret. it's just not talked about."
1177,yes,"try doing a search for ""zelensky farmland monsanto"" on google and compare it with brave search. it's not even a minor difference, google is totally labotomized.

what's the political implications of companies defining what is and isn't ""the truth""?

1179,yes,">theyre good but they are nowhere near as good as google was in 2013.
yeah its interesting on one phone i have bing, another brave search and on desktop i use yandex. but on ny pixel i left the built in search box as google.
google can serve much better results but you have to wade through a fuck ton of ads and if the topic can be jewish slanted it absolutely will be
it's kind of bizarre to see glimmers of technology superiority shining through obvious propaganda and layers upon layers of activist employees. they're so incompetent they can't hide their meddling even after all these years"
1180,yes,"i dont use google. startpage, brave search, duckduckgo or yandex. i'm surprised it didn't show up on yandex. wtf even is hdzog?"
1181,yes,"yandex especially the image search is very reminiscent of google back in the 2000s

the only us based search engine i’d recommend is brave search but that’s still in beta."
1182,yes,">there are people who is still using google
>not brave search and yandex
shameful"
1183,yes,"metager (preferably the onion), qwant, or brave search alternately should give you decent results usually. maybe yandex as backup."
1184,yes,"brave is kiked like google
look at the comparison when looking up ""dancing israelis"" on yandex and brave search. brave gives the same deboonked results as google"
1185,yes,"yandex (images), searx
brave search which is like seraching on google and bing, but through a proxy"
1186,yes,"here try these
https://searx.si/
https://search.bus-hit.me/
https://baresearch.org/

they are public instances of searx or searxng which is a meta search engine (it queries bing, google, brave search, etc)
you can also run an instance of this yourself but try some of the public ones to see if you like it, it is also very customisable"
1187,yes,"google, bing.com, even brave search do not find the image in the first few pages, yet yandex returns it as #2 image. it is being suppressed by western interests of a certain glow."
1188,yes,"i saw a website do a comparison of all major search engines on politically incorrect subjects. yandex was the least censored, closely followed by bing. duckduckgo and things like searx based on it are pretty censored.
brave search is pretty good and getting better and not censored that i know. it lost the competition because it wasn't as good at finding links that were only a few hours old. but thats kind of unfair against a small new search engine."
1189,yes,"yep. a lot of these shock twitter screenshot threads work like that. make sure you use alternative search engines.

1192,yes,"you can use ""searx"", it's open source and you can find an instance close to you(for speed),
a easier option is to simply use the brave browser, it come with the brave search engine wish is good enough for most things(privacy, speed , usability), if you do a 10 min run in the parameters to disable the annoying popups and reinforce a little the slightly too lax inter-site connectivity (google/fakebook inserts) can and should be disable (i am running it right now)"
1193,yes,">google results
pretty sure google has a deal with them to do this too. 
brave search, yandex and ddg all show far less results for reddit and wikipedia. 
>muh google is the best search 
fuck no it isn't. first page is almost always fucking wikipedia and reddit results."
1194,yes,"brave search has been working okay, can't make a definite assertion yet.
startpage is hit or miss accuracy-wise, but largely unpozed and privacy-driven.
searx is meh cuz it's clunky to set-up optimally, but open-source and flexible."
1195,yes,"very important reminder to matrix illiterates: 
use yandex, brave.search eventually bing or any proxy-ed or not alternative search engine that values privacy.
it's fundamental that you use brave or other privacy compliant search engines to not let globohomo profile certain keywords and results by allowing them to index your data through proprietary https requests.

tldr:

don't use google chrome, firefox, bing and other mainstream browsers

don't use google search engine !!!!!!!!!"
1196,yes,"brave search has been shittening itself for a long time but the last straw was when they removed putting quotation marks around search terms to get results that match your query exactly.
it was the only way to cut through all the bot generated spam and they removed it not long after google did. 
the only two search engines worth a shit are yandex are marginalia."
1197,yes,"we did a sort of informal test a year or two ago of the different search engines censorship levels. yandex came back the least censored for most ""current things"" topics like covid, etc. followed by bing, with google being the worst. at the time brave search really sucked, but it was less censored than bing. it's much better now. i don't think it's censored at all. but it still often brings up mainstream news and wikipedia, etc."
1198,yes,"
would you mind making that shit less woke? i have to use brave search, bing and yandex. the only thing i google is store hours and such because that is the last usable feature on google search. the core product of search is the worst search engine out of the ones i use and it's because of how woke it is. censorship is retarded, google is retarded essentially."
1199,yes,"right answer, outdated meme.

it's still kicking but keep in mind they are fully compliant with going after anti semitism. 
there are a lot of options such as the fediverse, but those have proven not to be secure due to being run by nobodies who lack and web development or security experience.
>duckduckgo
uses microsoft web crawler, sells info to microsoft.
brave search is the only real alternative sadly. everyone else uses google or microsoft webcrawlers instead of their own inhouse one. you should alternate between search engines for better results.

they had a small hiccup in compliance with authorities with a warrant. other than that a solid choice.
there are others i think tauntura is one but i have a hard time remembering.

1201,yes,"anynone against yandex is a globohomo jew shill.
yandex, startpage, brave search, bing are a good combo.
probably there are even better search engines but for my use cases these are pretty good.
especially yandex for redpills, warez and esoteric shit you will never find on jew search engines.
remember google is a marketing scheme and it will collapse soon so i suggest anyone to unlink google services from all of your accounts, find any mail provider that isn't google and forget about it, they fucked up hard and this is only the beginning"
1202,yes,google and brave search have better results unfortunately because i would like to use yandex but the results on there are just not as good
1203,yes,"this, and maybe its for the best. i use brave search and it has an auto-ai that answers basic questions pretty well so i don't have to click on a bunch of links.
however, it all depends on who trains the ai. what they call ""trust & safety"" is the single biggest threat, google's ai and openai are harbingers of what happens when you have lefties deciding whats appopriate and whats not"
1204,yes,"brave search is made by pete the jew.
google is controlled.
microsoft search is controlled.
duckduckgo is a controlled op for retards.
yandex is google but russian.

brave search and yandex are probably the best available search engines but i don't use them, i just use google for normie shit and 4plebs for everything else (99% of my searches)."
1206,yes,"yeah. it used to be worth using because google images was way better than any other, but nowadays it's fulled with shitty ai art. best to just use brave search or duckduckgo."

any other good google alternatives?"
1208,no,"1) google it was founded by larry page, sergey brin in 1998. both are jews.

4) wikipedia the website that help you make your assignments most of the times, is also founded by a jew. jimmy wales is a jew.
5) ask.com you might open this website too sometimes if you are a college graduate and look for ready made answers for your assignments. bad news for you, this was also founded by a jew, garrett gruener.

1211,yes,">anything i can do against this so i can have access to information
i have outlined a project that can be made very easily and cheaply by 1 software engineer who knows how to write browser plugins. 
at the very least, since nobody really cares at google, someone can create a plugin / filter for google search results, that will remove some common garbage from g search results. that can be customizable for each user.

this can be easily converted for other search engines, such as duckduckgo and bing. not sure about yandex, but last time i checked russians are pretty good at allowing various filters. 

see these posts: 
the next step would be getting a computer with a bunch of storage or a server , in a hosting or even at home, and an open source software that can run your own search engine. possibly look at elastic search (not open source , as a concept), majestic , etc. storage and hosting is so cheap that you really don't need any finances to start.

1212,no,"step by step is just looking at code/flow diagram and following script: input is that, it goes here, here and here, not here, hm, why did it do that here, aha, error is here, go fix that and make task to add to test suite.
>architect
1. ok, we have data incoming in constant flow, some in parts, but we will collect it in one piece, so lets make it broker, need some persistence and ability to add more steps and retries, will use kafka, kafka is cool.
2. now, we need to store some user data, sql is good, postgres is good and free, here, dont forget balance and shit.
3. next step - we need aggregations and lots of text filtering, data looks like a mess, so nosql, text, aggs - it is elasticsearch time! wait, legal called, its opensearch, bugger.
4. now, we have one dev, two junes, grab python and look some cool framework.
5. ml models? easy shit, seldon it.
6. so data processing involve lots of steps, lets slap state machine on it.
7. async, bitch
8. kubernetes, iam, pdp, nginx

done. gonna write some lines and figure out caches and aggregations storage, but it is done.

now where is logic here?"
1213,yes,"they didn't get there first. 
before google we had alta vista, hotbot, ask jeaves, and a shit ton of other directories and search engines that tanked. google started out as a university project funded with government grants. it was originally a shit-ton of consumer-grade internal pc hard drives sitting on shelves. it succeeded because while existing search engines were all subverted with porno spam, google still gave relevant results -- it was somehow immune. youtube has really never had an equal. it has operated at a loss for most of its existence, and it would not surprise me if it still does. i'm sure it's a loss leader for google.

pornhub's job was to put regular subscription pay sites out of business by shamelessly stealing their content and saying, ""whatcha gonna do about it? sue me? hahahahha, no judge will take your side, pervert!"" they 100% destroyed affiliate marketing for adult paysites."
1214,yes,"
they didn't return nearly as many pages, but we already had webcrawler, hotbot, and altavista before google arrived on the scene in 1998.

i remember being very impressed by how many pages hotbot could find for the same search terms compared to webcrawler."
1215,yes,google didn't even exist until 1998 and it was just an aggregator that ran off of yahoo and hotbot when it launched. google didn't become good until the 2000s you stupid millenial faggot
1216,yes,">i mean in the 90's and early 2000's
there were search engines before google: yahoo! was the main one, but hotbot was my fav. the websites were all ugly flat html, business ones included. instead of blogs/vlogs there was stuff like geocities with really bad design like the one posted earlier itt: https://stefangagne.com/spatulacity/ and then later came myspace which you probably know about.

instead of torrents there were ftp sites for warez (pirated software and games). you could spend several days downloading all of the parts because speeds were so slow. same with pronz.

people spent a lot of time on irc and chat rooms shooting the bull like we do here now. ""cybering"" was the predecessor to sexting, and there was tons of trolling going on with that. see transcripts from bloodninja: http://megalomaniac.com/~andrew/funny/bloodcyber.html"

>bing
>yahoo (but i think this is just powered by google)?
back in the day you had altavista, webcrawler, ask jeeves, hotbot, excite, etc. it was such a better time."
1218,yes,"hotbot was much better and indexed within days instead of months. 
>""find results, not ancient history""
in 1999, google was pretty pathetic, and hotbot was superseded by nothernlight and alltheweb. 
northernlight was working on ocring and indexing all newspaper articles ever committed to microfiche, but folded before anything came of it. both northernlight and alltheweb indexed one billion pages and found you the weirdest, most obscure stuff anyone could think of, while google was more or less english-only at that time. my own stuff showed up in the ego-feed within hours, with google not so fast, and yahoo and altavista was pretty much legacy trash. (again, 1999. btw., i had ca. 1.5mbit always-online at the time, for pocket change, thanks to the regional cable tv provider.)"

1220,no,"here one last gift before i leave to go climbing
i could of not cared less. i am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. in an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. we often put our false mortality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-madonnas, but you seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. so i ask you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. in your argument you seem to throw everything but the kids nysnc, and even though you are having a feel day with this i am here to bring you back to into reality, because it's now like the pot calling the kettle cracked. i have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. it is almost spooky, because i cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. i have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. you just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.

irregardlessly, make my words, when you get down you brass stacks it doesn't take a rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. it's clear who the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts, instead of baking a half bread effort. you might have to come to this conclusion though denial and error but i swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake. except the fax. irregardlessly, i guess it was inevadible...."
1221,no,"something is surely being lost in translation, because i doubt any of the men are virgins. maybe a fraction of 1% are.
they also have a humility thing where they will feel the need to lie in order to spare the person asking the question from receiving an unnecessarily truthful answer that might make the questioner uncomfortable about his own life. 100% of japanese do this. so the question itself can't even really be reliably asked to anyone.
japanese have no incentive to enter a real relationship. the men there can be fully sexually satisfied by women without ever entering a relationship.
for instance, japan has blowjob bars everywhere. ""pinsaros"".
you go in, buy a drink, and get a tender and loving blowjob from the beautiful young loli server. no condom. she has this down to a science in the way you can only expect from the japanese. she'll make you feel pleasure you didn't know your body was even capable of experiencing.
or if you really want to treat yourself, you order the ""flower petal rotation"" where three girls rotate through taking turns blowing you until you cum.
you just sit back and enjoy watching them suck your dick and listening to their cute squeaks. colorful lights flash around you and the thumping uplifting trance music plays. they swallow and gently clean the dribbled sperm off your tummy afterwards.
and from your post, i can tell you have barely even scratched the surface of their porn. keep your language set to japanese and you can find really nasty videos on dmm. my favorite are the ones where three girls are working together on a man in the following fashion: one is gently sucking his dick, one is gently licking his anus, and one is gently rubbing his nuts and tummy. all are very convincingly uttering moans of joy just from the happiness they're feeling by making the man feel pleasure. there are thousands of videos of variations this exact scenario. all real"

you have to understand, my silly young coomer friend, that google, bing, duckduckgo and the likes arent real ""search"" enginges. they arent meta-crawlers either. they are business own registers, controlled and groomed (alghoritms etc) by the interests of the business and it owners. 

google, bing and shit-a-like have as much to do with free speech, free flow of information and free development of the mind as a pile of bullshit has to do with a decent, loving wife cocked meal.

google was co-sponsored by the cia, and the nsa cooperates with microsoft (bing) since - at least - windows98.
