alternatives to google products:
google search - duckduckgo, qwant, startpage
google chrome - firefox and related browsers (i.e. palemoon, seamonkey), brave browser, comodo dragon. pic related is old but possibly useful to you, although i disagree with discounting browsers like brave and opera just because they look like they'll never become popular.
youtube - honestly this is probably the hardest to cut off for everyone, it's so ingrained into the internet at this point. sharing videos via webm is an option. you can download youtube videos into webm format using hooktube. for videos that are only on youtube (unfortunately, a lot), you can search for and watch them on duckduckgo for better privacy protection via youtube’s “youtube-nocookie” domain. in terms of serious alternatives: peertube, bitchute.
google maps - openstreetmap, maps.me
google drive - dropbox, mega
android - ubuntu touch, lineageos, sailfish os, plasma mobile
blogger - ghost (paid unfortunately). i don't know a good alternative that isn't paid.

in terms of how behaviors in a network change over time we should go for the smallest and most influential communities first because that gives you the most momentum to start and i think we could get all of their networks to duplicate or switch their alternatives over 2 years.
