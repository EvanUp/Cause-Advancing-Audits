Jared Kushner is not The Head of the Illuminati. However all the things I have said so far are true, and he sort of has a similar background to the real Head.

Kushner is some guy who has ended up crawling into three of our primary parameters, as he purchased 666 5th Avenue which is a building we need and he got engaged to Ivanka Trump who is the girl we need. He also has enough incidental similarities to the head that I can describe the Head of the Illuminati in a way that people will assume I am describing Kushner, but it's not him.

So Rupert Murdoch is kind of like the guy monitoring the situation and we are going to do a big build up where the Head of the Illuminati smashes Kushner the fuck down, and Kushner is kind of like a fall guy to build up the Chief's power by making a big deal of how he kicked the ass of this rich kid handsome billionaire and stole his girlfriend.

The real head who I work for is someone who no one has ever heard of and he's incredibly, incredibly bizarre. He is in some stuff on the internet, but it's really strange shit.

So for example, the real head is also a boy genius who is from New Jersey and is Jewish and went to Harvard, but he is very eccentric, like sometimes he dresses like this:

You could download pirated games directly from websites (like happyhippo.com) without worry and up until about 1999 those sites were immune from prosecution because the feds couldn't understand much about the internet back then.

People would join small but bustling web forums in the early 00's for just about every type of subject matter.

Cable internet existed in the 90's, and if like me you were fortunate to have it, you were invincible. Still, even 56k and even 36k modems were tolerable. It was slow, but tolerable.

anyway, by mid-way through 2000, the money had dried up and i was unemployed and homeless, shooting dirty biker speed and shit in the lower east side. sometimes i'd see old colleagues who just kind of looked through me and kept on their way. i'd jump shelter to shelter and get kicked out for being tweaked out of my trees, during the winter of 2000-2001 i'd commit petty crime like public defecation just to get a warm place to sleep for the night.

Spacing for readability and organization.

OldNet you had a to make a website. It wasn't hard. It COULD be. I remember learning HTML myself in 7th grade using my dad's college text books. Most hosting sites had easy builder options. This was eliminated by social media.

OldNet had forums. If you wanted to talk a out something you had to find a site with a forum for it. And they were slow. Like, checking back in 2 days slow. NuNet has reddit, so whatever you want to talk about has the same environment and same rules.

OldNet had P2P clients for music and movies. NewNet has streaming services and spotify.

OldNet had a barrage of video websites. Tons of then. Some worked shitty and some just worked alright. NuNet has YouTube. Again; all in one place, same set of rules.

OldNet had websites. Web Sites. There was a .com for practically everything. There was a barrage of places to go and discover. I remember being in middle school and just typing in [randomthings].com to see if there was a website named it. NuNet contains domains of businesses.

OldNet had precursors to social consolidation, but there were options. Yahoo. Excite. Lycos. Each with their own email domains, chat rooms, games, articles. NuNet has Gmail and no more all in one, do it all here kind if sires anymore.

Switching directions here, search engines finally got GOOD. But now, deep in the NuNet, if it doesn't exist on the first page of results of Google, it doesn't exist. Not even that, if it's not spoon fed above the results of the Google search, it doesn't exist. Normies thunk since they type in ""Covid Vax Side Effects,"" into Google and doesn't appear in bold before all the websites telling you where to go to get the vax, it doesn't exist.

","Yeah it's a whole lot more than just bots on social media/message boards. The search results are culled, users are herded into corporate hubs, independent creation is concealed or banned. I would search random things for fun in 1996 on lycos or excite. I was 9 years old. I remember searching ""boogers"" and there were hundreds of silly amateur sites, poems and songs about boogers, booger games, personal booger collection. Search ""boogers"" now and you get pages of sterile medical/encyclopedic information in boogers from garbage corporate globohomo sites. The old angelfire and geocities sites were purged. The blog trend that followed was too, and discouraged and delisted. If you want booger songs now you have to change your terms and search that specifically and maybe you'll get something Reddit or buzzfeed approved. Search ""silver fork"" and you're not going to get the interconnected creative human world's personal impressions of silver forks, you're going to get pages upon pages upon pages of the same few basic sites, Wikipedia, Etsy, Amazon etc in every search engine. You just can't find the massive massive real human element that should exist. 

Back then I lived in a small rural redneck county and our local dialup had a multiple chatroom forum that would be active with hundreds of people. In 1996 with dialup in the middle of nowhere! And yet the Facebook and neighborhood apps, which require far less attention and time niche/money investment in a more connected higher populated period of time...are LESS active than the chatrooms were 25 years ago

Ah, the good, old days. I remember paying my classmate 1 buck to google cheats for AoE2 on lycos and print them out for me.
For my zoomer lads: that was the last time we had privacy. You could be unreachable for a whole day, and when you agreed to meet someone, you had to arrange the time and place beforehand, as well as look up the route yourself. You could truly be disconnected. If you did something embarrassing, it would only spread by word of mouth among your peer group, not at the speed of light all over the whole world. There were no online lynchmobs, no minute-to-minute updates on what everyone was doing, no instant access to all public information on every issue. You could, in short, be human, only having to deal with issues which a human is equipped to deal with. On the flip side, people were quite ignorant (as opposed to today, when they know about everything, but are comically misinformed). There was also a general feeling of optimism about the future: the Cold War, what people thought of as the last vestige of WW2 at the time, had ended, and people looked naively towards a better future of liberal democracies and space exploration. ""Go to school, study hard, and you'll get a good job"" still rang true. There was no pervasive feeling of paranoia and no acquiescence to the surveillance state; no terrorism (except for the Palestinians, but those attacks were far away and few and far between). It was, in short, a break from history. Then the Muslims, and the boomers and their investments into stocks and housing fucked it all up.",HU,NA,FALSE,NA

Myocarditis in adolescents (particularly teenage boys) has been reported following the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.1–7 Since cardiac biopsies are rarely performed in these instances with clinically stable patients, the myocardial pathology has not been clearly elucidated.8 Myocarditis is rarely diagnosed at autopsy in deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.9,10 The incidence of myocarditis, although low, has been shown to increase after the receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine, particularly after the second dose among young male recipients.11 In addition, the first week after the second vaccine dose was found to be the main risk window.11 The clinical presentation of myocarditis after vaccination was usually mild.11 ""

Searching always took skill effort time. Nothing's really changed except now many people think they are being informed while the exact opposite is taking place.

","These corporations all have a common denomenator: Indian subversion. These fuckers have been infiltrating tech since at least the 80s. Corporations appear to completely shift in terms of culture and ethos once pajeets take hold, and once one takes over as CEO the degeneration is complete.

Sundar Pichai, became CEO of Google in 2015. Same year their search algorithm began it's slow decent into becoming unusable.

Satya Nadella, became CEO of Microsoft in 2014. Next year, Windows 10 was released and double downed on everything the Windows user base had criticized about 8 and 8.1, telemetry exploded in this release.

Pajeets have been slowly destroying all record of the fun internet of old and removing all that we enjoyed about it during their march toward total erasure by ""Web 3.0."" Lycos, the company that owned Angelfire and Tripod, was sold to an Indian company, Ybrant Digital, in 2010. Archives of these classic sites were purged once this company took over.

Yahoo!, owner of GeoCities, kept the service alive in Japan until 2019 (as well as the classic Yahoo! Search, Yahoo! Images and Yahoo! Videos). Guru Gowrappan took over as CEO of Yahoo! the prior year and served until 2021. Most GeoCities archives, including the Japanese sites, have now been lost.
