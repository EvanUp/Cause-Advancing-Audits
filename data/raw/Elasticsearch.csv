","independent/dependent isn't bad but I still think primary/replica is better. if the master dies a slave get promoted, which is why replica encapsulates that a bit better imo. it seems weirder for a ""dependent"" to become ""independent""

at work we can't even use master as the main branch anymore


leader/follower isn't bad, but the leftists are going to take issue with it anyway

I like primary/replica: it's the same terminology elasticsearch uses, and I think it is fairly accurate. it's tough to encapsulate the notion that writes go to the master, the slaves receive the state of the world from the masters and can double as ""read replicas"" (can be read from), etc

anyway it's all a moot point because no matter what term gets settled on, they're going to come out in 2 years and be like ""actually prrimary/replica implies a power dynamic, there's nothing wrong with being the read replica, let's call it ""the folk that receives da writes and da folk dat read da writes hurrr durrr""

","I switched to marketing/analytics after development. I would go with something like Django/Go/Node. A working MVP with uploads, account functionality, and plugging all that into something like Elasticsearch is a nice easy way to get started. Can probably even abstract that away with some of those tools that plug into your data sources and give you nice little tools and filters.

To get people on the site is pretty easy. If I was starting an amateur porn site, I would simply violate all copyright laws and watch as western governments don't give a single fuck about protecting that IP. I would literally ignore and piss on their cease and desists and call their lawyers niggers (that's if they could find out who I am). What are they going to do? Sue me for stealing their hardcore pornography.

When we tell the jury the site is low-key full of child porn, they WILL NOT SIDE WITH THEM.

Back to getting people on the site, the usual methods: paid ads (#1 driver, but costly), astroturfing (cheaper, but LTV of customer is lower because they're literal retards who fell for shill spam), and finally exclusive deals with content creators (preferably amateur ones).

You could even throw this all on a blockchain and distance yourself from it that way you're never doxxed (the NSA will know who you are, but they get the same treatment as the lawyers: call them niggers and tell them to fuck off). 

Also, at a certain point, I would use all the profit and resources to start training AI deep fake models. You'd be solving human trafficking concerns and being able to produce products (content) cheaper and faster than your employees. You could also target certain traits based on user engagement and generate videos that correlate with that.

If you start making it big, watch out for the Hungarians and Israelis. When they see you on their turf, they WILL try to harm you.

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-have-stolen-data-on-1-billion-chinese-citizens/
On Sunday, Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng confirmed that his company's threat intelligence experts spotted ChinaDan's claims and said that the leak was likely due to an ElasticSearch database that a Chinese government agency accidentally exposed online.

""Our threat intelligence detected 1 billion resident records for sell in the dark web, including name, address, national id, mobile, police and medical records from one asian country. Likely due to a bug in an Elastic Search deployment by a gov agency,"" Zhao said.

""This has impact on hacker detection/prevention measures, mobile numbers used for account takeovers, etc.""

Zhao later added that ""apparently, this exploit happened because the gov developer wrote a tech blog on CSDN and accidentally included the credentials.""

Wall Street Journal reporter Karen Hao reached out to dozens of people who had their data allegedly stolen in the breach and said that some of them confirmed all the info available in the leaked sample.

""At this point, it's impossible to confirm the scale of the data leak, but five of the people who picked up verified all of the case details listed with their name — information that would would be difficult to obtain from any source other than the police,"" Hao said.

""The other four confirmed basic information like their names before hanging up.""

If ChinaDan's claims are proven to be accurate, this would be the most significant data breach ever impacting China and one of the largest in history.

I have outlined a project that can be made very easily and cheaply by 1 software engineer who knows how to write browser plugins. 
At the very least, since nobody really cares at Google, someone can create a plugin / filter for Google search results, that will remove some common garbage from G search results. That can be customizable for each user.

This can be easily converted for other search engines, such as DuckDuckGo and Bing. Not sure about Yandex, but last time I checked russians are pretty good at allowing various filters. 

See these posts: 
The next step would be getting a computer with a bunch of storage or a server , in a hosting or even at home, and an Open source software that can run your own search engine. Possibly look at elastic search (not open source , as a concept), Majestic , etc. Storage and hosting is so cheap that you really don't need any finances to start.
