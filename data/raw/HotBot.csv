","Nothing since has come close to Hotbot. You could do ultra-complex Boolean searches with nothing you told it leave out and exact phrases only. There was no curation and the results for most things were highly relevant. Google was nearly as good until they retired encrypted.google.com.

in 1999, google was pretty pathetic, and hotbot was superseded by nothernlight and alltheweb. 
Northernlight was working on OCRing and indexing all newspaper articles ever committed to microfiche, but folded before anything came of it. Both northernlight and alltheweb indexed one billion pages and found you the weirdest, most obscure stuff anyone could think of, while google was more or less english-only at that time. My own stuff showed up in the ego-feed within hours, with google not so fast, and yahoo and altavista was pretty much legacy trash. (Again, 1999.
