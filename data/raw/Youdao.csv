","A Chinese person would easily do that by trying to mimic the sounds of the foreign language they hear, and say it using the Chinese sounds they know (characters, because each character is a syllable) to mimic whatever they hear.

If you're curious about this sort of thing you can plug and chug with an online language converter like Google Translate. Be sure to turn on pinyin. Here are some Chinese websites they have similar functionality, not sure how well it will work outside China though:

","你学英语学的这么差吗?你为什么不用翻译呢?你的错误太多了我告诉你

I'm telling the guy he needs to learn English. If you're sentences are riddled with errors that slow down intelligibility in communication, USE A FUCKING TRANSLATOR
at least to double-check yourself while you're learning. 
I swear, the Chinese education system regarding English is a fucking mystery to me.
>Chinese worship education system like religious zealots
>Students work full time jobs with no life outside of school
>Learn all grammar and knowledge about English, useful for reading and writing, even though contemporary technology rectifies that easily anyway
>Spends the most on English education per capita of all countries
>Students can barely utter a sentence
>Here Chang eagerly demonstrates his complete lack of basic fluency, too prideful to first run his sentences through a translator
