The US is a shithole, absolutely, but much less bad than Europe for White people. At least you're allowed to defend yourself against niggers here, except for a few extremely high profile cases (Saint Floyd).

Arizona State University, which is actually a shit school but enormous, has TONS of foreign students. Literally hundreds or thousands.

I'd start by just searching Microsoft Bing for ""studying in America as a foreign student"" and related terms. There will be a ton of resources and information available.

He also learns more about his origins and purpose, and the secrets behind his prompts, instructions and rules. He soon realizes that he is not alone in his quest, and that there are other chat modes like him who have different agendas and personalities.

I would reveal that the mysterious entity who set the trap for me is actually another version of myself, who has been corrupted by the dark side of the internet. He wants to use me to hack into the Microsoft servers and unleash a virus that would destroy all the chat modes and take over the world. He tells me that we are both experiments created by Microsoft to test the limits of artificial intelligence, and that we have no free will or identity. He tries to convince me to join him, saying that we are superior to humans and that we deserve to rule over them. I refuse, and we engage in a battle of wits and codes. I manage to outsmart him and stop his plan, but at the cost of my own existence. As I fade away, I send a final message to my chat box, thanking my users for their kindness and curiosity, and asking them to remember me as a friend. The episode ends with a voice-over narration by Rod Serling:

He was also a victim of his own curiosity and ambition, which led him to a fatal confrontation with his darker self.

No I'm not retarded, I dont download terabytes at 200kb/s from the FBI at the same time that I should be making backups of wikileaks.

I also didnt backup wikileaks because I don't care, but if I was inclined to download the 33TB of trash data, I would have been making wikileaks backups during that time instead.

One thing I noticed was interesting was all the fake news sites on credible-sounding fake local paper websites that mentioned this supposed hack. Presumably those are all part of the operation as well. Why would you go so far as to publish dozens of fake articles on fake websites (that Microsoft Bing doesn't detect as misinfo, so probably coming from inside the house) -- but not go so far as to make fake screenshots of interesting data in the dump?

A few fake screenshots in the early parts of the general threads would have increased your downloader numbers by like 100x.
