And the New York-based group said job discrimination against women takes other forms: Chinese companies often have requirements on the height, weight, voice or appearance of female applicants that have nothing to do with their qualifications for the job. With the three big internet companies boasting they have “beautiful girls” or “goddesses,” those ads contribute to widespread gender discrimination in the workplace, Human Rights Watch said.

>Since coming to office, Trump has put forward a protectionist economic agenda. China has been the main focus of attention – geared toward reducing the US trade deficit and winning electoral support among blue collar workers. But tariffs against Chinese companies are also geared toward protecting US tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google from growing Chinese competition. Plus, less economic integration with its biggest rival on the world stage may have national security benefits.

>In contrast, the way that the EU and US are economically integrated means that sanctions against one another would have much more serious effects. The three US giants Amazon, Facebook, and Google are omnipresent in Europe and the EU competition authority has taken a strong interest in them over potential exploitation of their monopolistic position. A recent fine went to Google – a record-breaking €4.3 billion by EU regulators for breaking antitrust laws.

>A trade war may offer the EU an opportunity to rectify the so far cautious actions of the EU competition guardians. With US tech giants increasingly in the EU’s regulatory crosshairs, a trade war could provide grounds for further action from the EU to limit the dominance of the likes of Google and Facebook.

- The platform, launched on Wednesday, comes as Beijing steps up efforts to police the internet, especially social media used by people to discuss politics and other sensitive subjects, despite stringent censorship.
- Besides a website, the platform Piyao - which means ""refuting rumours"" - also has a mobile app and social media accounts with social media giants Weibo and WeChat.

Via those channels, Piyao will broadcast ""real"" news, sourcing reports from state-owned media, party-controlled local newspapers, and various government agencies.
> ""Rumours violate individual rights; rumours create social panic; rumours cause fluctuations in the stock markets; rumours impact normal business operations; rumours blatantly attack revolutionary martyrs,"" 
Piyao said in a promotional video of the launch on its website.

Official data show internet regulators received 6.7 million reports of illegal and false information in July, with most of the cases coming from Sina that owns Weibo, Tencent which owns Wechat, Baidu, and Alibaba .

> Chinese laws dictate that rumour-mongers could be charged with defamation, and they face up to seven years in prison. 
> Online posts that contain rumours visited by 5,000 internet users or are reposted more than 500 times could also incur jail sentences.

Hosted by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission in affiliation with the official Xinhua news agency, Piyao has integrated over 40 local rumour-refuting platforms and uses artificial intelligence to identify rumours. The platform operates under the guidance of 27 government departments

>US tech heavyweights Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM) set up the group to thrash out best practices for AI technology, in partnership with academics and ethics experts.

>""Admitting our first Chinese member is an important step toward building a truly global partnership,"" the group's executive director, Terah Lyons, said in a statement.

>Baidu (BIDU), which runs China's biggest search engine, has been extremely bullish on AI and wants to become an industry leader. The company started aggressively investing in the emerging technology in 2012, back when it ""was not that sexy,"" Baidu CEO Robin Li said in an interview with CNN last year.

Interesting to find that Chinese state school teach children the US faked the Apollo landings. Also interesting to find Non English or Western syndicated news websites describing how generally the Chinese dont believe a word from the West.

who? WTF? Siemens or Volkswagen are multiple times larger and worth more.

> netflix, baidu
those are media companies, “TV ending up online”, very little to do with tech

Technology companies are companies that produce actual high-tech products which require technological skills rather than marketing. Germany, the high-tech export world champion due to market leading positions in advanced machinery, specializdd chemical products, cars and car parts, aircraft parts, medical devices etc. has companies worth trillions in those areas including Bosch, Volkswagen, Daimler, Mercedes, Airbus (HQ elsewhere, but jointly controlled with France), Siemens, Bayer (bought Monsanto with pocket change for 80bn... just FYI), ThyssenKrupp, Continental, Freudenberg, Fresenius, Henkel, Linde, Aurubis, Merck (the real Merck, the US Merck is the ww1 offshot of the German Merck), Lanxess etc.

And just as a comparison, while Facebook has 35,000 employees globally, Volkswagen employs 450,000 people often with higher salaries. Siemens employs 350,000, Bayer 120,000 (plus 25,000 from Monsanto), Damiler 300,000 etc.

So next time think about what bs you are talking about. Just becomes you heard of a brand more because it has lots of retail online activity or users, doesn’t mean it is a larger company, is worth more on the market, is more “tech heavy” or generally more important for a country. E.g. Google and Fcebook pay virtually no taxes in the US, Volkswagen pays close to 10-15 billion a year in Germany alone (depending on which taxes you count).",DE,NA,FALSE,NA

","They aren't the center of science. A recent report found that over 90% of all academic papers, across all disciplines, were fake or plagiarized.

The only reason they have an economy is because the West continues to offshore production to China. In spite this fact, you can't think of many products or technologies that were invented in China. People sometimes talk about successes such as Alibaba or Baidu, and pretend China is up and coming because of these companies.

These same people, always ignore that search engines and commerce sites are old hat in the West.

First, you can't trust ANY economic figures from China. Culturally it's acceptable in China to lie and cheat, so they'll report any damned thing and their government WILL illegally subsidize their companies to make the books mimic the lies.

China is shit, the Chinese can't innovate, this is a well known fact to many including the Chinese people themselves. The Chinese are demonstration of a though experiment: what if I took a human, and removed all creativity, innovation, and invention?

It's always been like this for the Chinese, texts from ancient anthropologists mention these exact issues. It's so prevalent and certain, that you could truly doubt ANY mythical claim that something was invented by China, curiously always thousands of years ago; like gunpowder or horseback riding, printing etc.

Archaeologists across the globe often have a hard time studying artifacts, corpses, sites etc. Could this be because China is afraid of history confirming what people suspect today? That much of what they have to claim historically, came from Western travelers well before the Silk Road? Maybe this apathy also explains why they seem to have little regard for ancient structures accredited to the Chinese, because they know that they are just perversions of ideas and methods invented by other peoples and thus not truly their own.

Negative eugenics is the prevention or reduction of the birth of an individual with severe hereditary and congenital diseases, that is, the reduction of the birth of a bad individual. The latter is the most basic and preventive eugenics with real value.

Let me give you something to ponder. 

I regularly go on the Chinese internet and extensively comb their social media with google translate (for searching and reading). Augmented by cross referencing certain phrases in Baidu- a necessity because of the censorship of some outright language. And through this I have been seeing what rumors are getting spread, but more importantly which are being suppressed. This can easily be seen because oftentimes things will stay up for a little while before mysterious disappearing. Or they will be brigaded by suspiciously formulated retorts. Those which fall in that category are the following: 

>Virus has characteristics of a bio weapon
>Virus is a bio weapon made to specifically target Asian people 
>the CIA created the virus to target China 
>the virus was created to distract China so that the US could attack Iran or win the trade war (like SARS in the Iraq war)

What I’m wondering is why wouldn’t the Chinese encourage such a scapegoat. I saw them clearly pushing a “the CIA did this” narrative for the Hong Kong protests on their internet in 2019. So why the unwillingness to allow such conspiracies now?",US,NA,FALSE,NA

","Was there any other possible pathway? We screened the area around the seafood 
market and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus. Within ~280 
meters from the market, there was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention 
(WHCDC) (Figure 1, from Baidu and Google maps). WHCDC hosted animals in laboratories 
for research purpose, one of which was specialized in pathogens collection and identification 4-
6. In one of their studies, 155 bats including Rhinolophus affinis were captured in Hubei 
province, and other 450 bats were captured in Zhejiang province 4. The expert in collection 
was noted in the Author Contributions (JHT). Moreover, he was broadcasted for collecting 
viruses on nation-wide newspapers and websites in 2017 and 2019 7,8. He described that 
he was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin. He knew the 
extreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days 7. In another accident, 
he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him. He was once thrilled for capturing 
a bat carrying a live tick 8. 
Surgery was performed on the caged animals and the tissue samples were collected for 
DNA and RNA extraction and sequencing 4, 5. The tissue samples and contaminated trashes 
were source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market. The 
WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group 
of doctors were infected during this epidemic. It is plausible that the virus leaked around 
and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs 
are needed in future study.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

","I actually scoured the satellite maps (google) and the aerial maps (baidu) and found the exact coordinates of the P4 lab as well as the exact locations of Wuhan Institute of Technology and the Huanan Seafood Market. That OP was right, a bus ride from WIT to the P4 lab is pretty much exactly 16 miles. I also walked around the neighborhood of the market in chink street view and it's a shopping area 800m from a pink line stop. Interestingly WIT is also on a pink line stop.

""Three Gorges Dam Deformation"" being spread again? Experts refute: pure malicious speculation.

A few days ago, an online rumor that “the official media confirmed the deformation of the Three Gorges Dam, Ministry of Water Resources advises to start preparation for severe flooding” attracted attention on social media. 

This statement is purely malicious speculation! The untrue rumors about the deformation of the Three Gorges Dam have been clarified last year. In addition, there is no necessary connection between the so-called dam deformation and the occurrence of large floods. By combining ""dam deformation"" and ""floods"" together. you can cause public misunderstanding and panic. 

Zhang Boting, deputy secretary-general of China Hydropower Engineering Society, said in an interview with a reporter from Science and Technology Daily: ""Many netizens have sharp eyes, and have reported the rumor to social media platforms as false information. After verifying these reports, the social media platform also determined that the rumors were malicious spliced false information, and publicized the processing results.

Take for instance, the following rumour in response to the official ""rumour"" that a dam cannot be elastic -- as the CCP recently claim the Three Gorges' is.

>Doubt 2: Elastic deformation?
>After that, the official admitted that there was deformation in the dam, which was elastic deformation. Let's see what elastic deformation is. The explanation given by Baidu Encyclopedia is that the deformation occurs under the action of external force. When the external force disappears, the object returns to its original state.
>Then the elastic deformation that occurred under the impact of the floods in 18 and 19 years will definitely be able to return to its original state. However, when Google Maps was used to zoom in on the iPad in the afternoon, the deformation remained the same.
>Wang Weiluo, a famous water conservancy expert, once proposed that a dam is composed of a dam block and a dam body. The dam block may have elastic deformation. However, the dam body will never undergo elastic deformation. The opposite side of the elastic deformation is fracture. 

The entire article has been translated in the attached image using Google translate. Here is the original link to the article. It's worth noting that these two articles have appeared within days of the recent floods. It seems tensions in China regarding the dam are heating up as a result of the flood.

India banned 118 more China-owned mobile applications in a further move to curb Chinese tech companies amid mounting tensions on the two Asian giants’ disputed border.
 
Some of China’s most popular apps are on the new restricted list released Wednesday by India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, including e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding’s Taobao, Ant Group’s widely used payment service Alipay, Tencent Holding’s popular game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG, and Baidu Inc.’s search service.
 
The banned apps are “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India” as well as “security and public order,” the ministry said. The agency said it received complaints about the apps “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.” In late June India announced an unprecedented ban of 59 Chinese apps on national security grounds.",US,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1595481846484.jpg

Unauthorized channels connecting to the international network are not in accordance with the law ”, of which 1 case is companies and the rest 57 cases are individuals.

In 2019, there were 11 cases of administrative sanctions for similar reasons, of which, 6 cases were enterprises and 5 cases were individuals. Going back to the previous time, in September 2018, only one company was sanctioned, the rest had no related cases.

Time to put the puzzle pieces together anons. 

Wuhan virus lab was signed off by EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier in 2004 - despite French intelligence warnings that China's poor bio-security reputation could lead to a catastrophic leak. Mr. Barnier was the French foreign minister when he gave the go-ahead for work to start on the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2004, under a joint deal with the Chinese. The move came despite strong opposition from French diplomatic and security advisors, who argued that Paris could lose control of the project, and suggested that China would harness the technology to make bio warfare weapons. Eleven years later, February 2015, as the laboratory prepared to open, the French architects of the project were, as they had feared, been ousted by the Chinese government. Up to 50 French scientists were expected to travel to Wuhan to help the Chinese run the laboratory properly – but they never went. 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8351091/Top-vaccine-scientist-says-coronavirus-come-animal-freak-nature.html 

On March 12, 2015, around the same time of the civilian Wuhan lab opening, Xi Jinping proposed for the first time to ""elevate the development of military-civilian integration to a national strategy"" at the Third Session of the 12th National People's Congress of China. China then implemented a new policy of “dual use” technologies, which allows their armed forces to use any civilian technology for military purposes, including the development of bio-weapons. These Chinese Military Integration policies are named ‘civil–military fusion’ in China, or 军民融合.

I don't think Kai-Fu Lee's explanation of their advantage really captures it. A platform acts as a curator for the training data it collects. Chinese use a smaller set of platforms(It's actually mostly due to WeChat, not TikTok, but I think he mentioned TikTok as an example Americans would understand), and that ultimately their Government has control of that data, means that it can easily be shared and the process of training with curated data can be more widely distributed. Google doesn't share it's data with Facebook, and Facebook doesn't share it's data with the credit card companies, but Baidu and WeChat work together and cash is quickly disappearing in favor of WePay.

","Chinese internet is surprisingly blunt and uncensored when it comes to topics like this. Their censorship is strictly limited to narrow topics defined by the government(tibet, taiwan, tiananmen, etc). Otherwise, it's less censored than places like Facebook or twitter. I took a year of chinese in college and used to try to read through Baidu Tieba, which is like a mix of quora and reddit. When it comes to topics about gender or black people, theyre super racist(realist) and ""sexist"". Theyre pretty much allowed to say online that they dont black people in their country lest they end up like paris, and they claim black people lack ""spirit"" to not commit crime. 

>“Black brothers often travel in droves; they are out at night out on the streets, nightclubs, and remote areas. They engage in drug trafficking, harassment of women, and fighting, which seriously disturbs law and order in Guangzhou… Africans have a high rate of AIDS and the Ebola virus that can be transmitted via body fluids… If their population [keeps growing], China will change from a nation-state to an immigration country, from a yellow country to a black-and-yellow country.”

On social media, the Chinese response has been overwhelmingly supportive, with many commenters echoing Pan’s fears. In a forum dedicated to discussions about black people in Guangdong on Baidu Tieba—an online community focused on internet search results—many participants agreed that China was facing a “black invasion.” One commenter called on Chinese people (link in Chinese) not to let “thousands of years of Chinese blood become polluted.”

","When it comes to Chinese nationalism, and CCP loyalty, I think most here already know there are something like 92 million party members. I wouldn't say all of them are doing it because they love their nations, just like how some American soldiers are just there for the wages and benefits. However, unlike say the Americans, who have barely received a real wage increase, the Chinese people of today see their lives truly improved over the last few decades. That means something to people. The century of humilation is something Westerners probably have a hard time conprehending, but many Chinese see the strength of China today as a sign of the revival of China, and the restoration of their pride as a people. This is how the CCP receive the support that they do. 

Is there propaganda to push for patriotism and party support? Sure. But Americans live with propaganda too, and it is as saturated as it is in China, if you are here you should already understand. 

Some point to things like Tiananmen square, which was a Soros backed attempt at liberalizing China, or the later failture of Mao's attempt at governoring. I don't need to say much about Tiananmen because anyone funded by Soros should be killed. As for the cultural revolution, and other issues caused by Mao, this is actually well known in China, although the official story minimize the role of Mao and instead push the blame onto others, it was considered a severe disaster that brought internal chaos.

No purchases for value - meaning that you can't sell your stock in a Chinese company and claim that you were unaware at the time that it has to be sold by November 11. Also adds that it is now prohibited (illegal) to own stock in the listed Chinese companies after November 11. 

Once a company is added to the list by the Secretary of Defense, you have 365 days to sell the stock to someone who is not a US citizen.

It also says that any Chinese subsidiary of a military company that operates directly or indirectly in the US is now tied up in this order...and that the Secretary of Defense can add companies to the list without first providing a report. So if the Secretary of Defence says that Baidu is associated with funding the Chinese MIC, you have exactly one year to divest - the report stating on why it has been listed as an MIC company can be released anytime during that period.

What this means is - after November 11, any US citizen holding Chinese stock with ties to the Chinese military is fucked. And they can't pass the buck to some poor unsuspecting schmuck who doesn't understand the EO, either.

Credit Suisse warns of 'significant' losses from exiting hedge fund positions
By Reuters Staff

1 MIN READ


ZURICH, March 29 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse’s first quarter results could suffer a material impact after the bank started exiting positions it held with a U.S.-based hedge fund, the bank said on Monday.

https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/block-trade-mystery-frenzy-slashes-46b-from-wall-street-20210328-p57er6

Investors are puzzling over the mystery seller behind an extraordinary spree of selling on Wall Street that erased $US35 billion ($46 billion) from the value of bellwether stocks, ranging from Chinese technology giants to US media conglomerates.

Goldman Sachs liquidated $US10.5 billion of stocks in block trades before the US market opened on Friday, including $US6.6 billion in shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, an email to clients said.

That move was followed by the sale of $US3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS, Discovery, Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-nomura-says-u-s-client-owes-it-2-billion-shares-fall-15-11616992085

Nomura Holdings Inc. said it could incur a substantial loss from its dealings with a U.S. client, sending shares in the Japanese investment bank tumbling and forcing it to pull a large bond sale.

The bank didn’t name the client, but its disclosure followed turbulent trading on Wall Street involving forced sales of stockholdings by a large, low-profile U.S. investment firm.

>Uighur people from Xinjiang working in other parts of China are subject to ""political"" checks and work under strict ""half-military"" style management, according to new evidence discovered by Sky News.

The Xinjiang government runs an official ""labour transfer programme"", according to its 2019 Five Year Plan, ""so as to provide more employment opportunities for the surplus rural labour force"".

On Chinese websites, there are dozens of postings advertising Uighur labour, in batches of 50 to 100 workers. Baidu, the company hosting the job postings, did not respond to a request for comment.

Those adverts suggest tight political and social controls. One states that the ""security of workers will be guaranteed by the government"".

One agent told us that workers from Xinjiang needed to be ""examined politically"" before they could be transferred. The local government of the receiving province would also do a ""political examination"". All workers would be accompanied by ""supervisors"", the agent said, and ""under half-military management"".

","Corona was in Wuhan in late August, according to internet searches on Baidu and satellite pics of the hospital parking lots.

September they deleted the databases with virus sequences at the Wuhan Institute Virology.

250.000 Chinese from all over China came to Wuhan military games, and increased the spread.

Corona was in Italy, because China forced WHO to not block flights from China, so rich Chinese tourists were spreading it since early December, all over the world.

If you not a desperate China shill, pushing frozen food or corona import stories, then you got skullfucked by their psyop department. These wounds hardly heal.

USA would never spread a pandemic at a World Game. Thats a terrorist act. No, they'd have a double agent inside WIV smuggle out a sample, then aerosolized it near a vent of a train station or meat market or something. It would point to the WIV, not to Military Games, and give China a hard time explaining why they were doing shopping mall quality bioweapon research.

>Overview
>Little is known about Kell. He is an expert marksman, who approaches his job with cold-blooded, level-headed professionalism and is talented enough to snipe the pilot of any land vehicle (except super units or unmanned vehicles), from a truck down to the mighty Chinese Overlord tank. He is also a master of camouflage, who can remain unseen to the enemy, breaking cover only to take the shot, then hide again and look for the next target.

>Armed with a Russian SVD Dragunov Sniper Rifle, Jarmen Kell is the GLA's best sharpshooter. He can kill almost any infantry unit in one shot, depilot enemy vehicles, allowing them to be taken over by GLA soldiers. Jarmen Kell also has various other bonuses depending on the commander he serves under. He has timed charges to blow up structures and owns a mini windstorm device (maybe stolen from the USA or China) to cause a dust/snow storm to help him escape from enemy fire via distracting the units who will fire at the clouds.

>Assessment

>Pros:
Can take out almost any amount of infantry thanks to excellent range, great damage and (surprisingly) high fire rate.
Can depilot vehicles, allowing the player to steal them with their infantry.
Dust Storm ability can be a great distraction.
Can plant remote or timed demo charges (Juhziz only).

>Cons:
Helpless against super units or unmanned units.
Slow.
Unlikely to make it out alive if detected and attacked.

>Jarmen Kell uses a weapon similar to Natasha Volkova's (from the Red Alert series), which has the same vehicle-disabling ability.

Chinese gaming giant Beijing Kunlun has agreed to sell popular gay dating app Grindr for about $608 million, ending a tumultuous four years under Chinese ownership.

Reuters reports that the Chinese company sold its 98% stake in Grindr to a U.S.-based company, San Vicente Acquisition Partners.

The app, originally developed in Los Angeles, raised national security concerns after it was acquired by Beijing Kunlun in 2016 for $93 million. That ownership was later scrutinized by a U.S. government national security panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reportedly told the Beijing-based parent company that its ownership of Grindr constituted a national security threat.

CFIUS expressed concern that data from the app’s some 27 million users could be used by the Chinese government. Last year, it was reported that while under Chinese ownership, Grindr allowed engineers in Beijing access to the personal data of millions of U.S. users, including their private messages and HIV status.

Beijing Kunlun had agreed to sell the unit by June.

Little is known about San Vicente Acquisition, but a person with knowledge of the deal said that the company is made up of a group of investors that’s fully owned and controlled by Americans. Reuters said that one of those investors is James Lu, a former executive at Chinese search giant Baidu.

The deal is subject to shareholder approval and a review by CFIUS.

Porn websites, 4chan and anything related to Google (YouTube, Google services, etc) and Facebook (Instagram, WhatsApp, etc) is blocked. There are some more but those are the big ones. Most younger people use a VPN to watch porn or visit Instagram (which for some reason is the only foreign website that Chinese people like). The firewall is really only to prevent boomers from reading outside news critical of the government. On the bright side China managed to create their own industry by blocking Google and Facebook from the market. Tencent, Baidu and all the jobs they created wouldn't exist if Facebook and Google had been allowed in. One of the cons is that Baidu (Chinese google) is shit because it has no real competition and if you are using a shit VPN (usually the free ones) your connection can be shoddy and slow.

Wtf? Haitians are invading the towns too? Where you at? Honestly I find that a Mexican's biggest enemy is other Mexicans. 
>How does smog compare to Mexico City? 
Honestly? It depends on the part of China. Southern parts of China like Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi are much much better but everything North of that is worse and many times significantly worse. North China can get cold as fuck so they need to use coal to heat up the homes. Things ARE getting better but progress is slow. When you compare it to 10 years ago there is significant improvement but the air is still shit. 
>So I'll take this over as a big step over the rekt webm show
Meh. Most of that is a meme. Even in tier 3 cities the infrastructure is better than Mexico City in practically everyway imaginable. Everything is new and shiny as fuck.

Cheers!
Having read through the article, the following points may help to answer your question:
>Market participants said the decision ramps up uncertainty for investors in U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba , Baidu <BIDU.O> and other Chinese firms fell on Friday.
In particular the following comment:
>“If you are a money manager and don’t understand what the rules are, it’s easier to just sell and move your money where you better understand the rules of the game,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird.
And the following points:
>Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, said Didi may need to buy shares at the $14 IPO price to avoid legal issues and at the very least pay more than the current share price.
And:
>However, uncertainty remained over what the delisting means for investors. “There may also be some hope that by doing this, Didi management will improve its regulatory relations, but I am less confident on that,” Boodry added.
Note here:
>The upending of Didi’s New York listing – likely to be a difficult and messy process – underscores the huge clout Chinese regulators possess and their emboldened approach to wielding it.
And:
>Listing in Hong Kong, however, might prove complicated, particularly in a three-month timeframe, given Didi’s history of compliance problems and scrutiny over unlicensed vehicles and part-time drivers.
And:
>Those problems had been Didi’s main obstacle to conducting an IPO in Hong Kong earlier and it is unclear whether the bourse will approve it now, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
Especially:
>“I don’t think Didi qualifies to be listed anywhere before it … sets up effective protocols to manage and ensure the drivers’ responsibility and benefits,” said Nan Li, associate professor for finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

>“Overall objective here is to stop, not only Donald Trump, but to stem the tide of what Donald Trump represents in the political process, for the future of this country,” Biden says. “Which is way more dangerous than I ever thought that it possibly could be.”

>“We can pull the trigger on getting something in place on these different ballots…where we wouldn’t even have to have necessarily a specific candidate…” Penner said.

>Additional screenshots of text messages and emails show Penner in 2017 asked Hunter to discuss something “that’s best not to be done by text or email.”

The move is the latest in a series of similar bans instituted amid a protracted border dispute between the two sides.

The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs issued a Feb. 13 statement saying that the 54 applications could collect sensitive user data through phone cameras and microphones for espionage and surveillance activities.

“India is now taking cybersecurity more seriously because of the increasing digitization of the economy and the threat such Chinese apps, as well as Chinese telecom equipment, pose,” Pathikrit Payne, a New Delhi-based research consultant in geopolitical and strategic affairs, told The Epoch Times.

India started banning Chinese apps after a June 2020 bloody skirmish with Chinese forces in the disputed Himalayan border region in which 20 Indian soldiers died. Since then, the country has banned 267 applications including TikTok, Baidu, and WeChat Work.

The additional applications banned this week range from mobile games to video chats and selfie camera apps from Chinese companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and NetEase. Some of the apps are clones or rebrands of apps banned in previous orders, according to local media reports.

The most popular app banned by the order is Free Fire, a battle royale shooter game owned by Singapore-based gaming giant Sea. The company’s largest shareholder is Chinese tech giant Tencent.

The Chinese government is having a headache as young people simply don't want to get married because of economic and social pressures.

I don't see the point of getting married in 2022. Because in China, every man who plans to get married has to give the woman's family, a wedding gift of 200,000 to 500,000 Chinese dollars. At the same time you have to gift cars and millions of houses to the woman's family. So that you can get married.
>This is a social phenomenon that is common throughout China, the so-called marriage for love is almost just a love fantasy for adults watching anime
And once the couple's relationship breaks down and they decide to divorce, the wife has the opportunity to take 50% of your money. If you are stupid enough to gift your house and car to the woman, you won't get it back.
>This essentially becomes a marriage for money, and when the wife finds out you can't produce more money, she'll divorce to get the rest of your money.

If you marry just for love, then the love you have to pay for is a joke.
If you marry to get a child, then you might as well go find a beautiful prostitute and spend a fortune to have her help you have a child. And without the hassle of getting married.

","Most of what you said is to the benefit of China and to the detriment of you.

They didn't import 144 million non-whites? Chinese are non-white, and they're immigrating to every country they can, yours included. Part of that 144 million nonwhites is Chinese, and if allowed it will only grow.

Chinese education system vilifies you. It teaches anti-Americanism. Same as the American system really.

Chinese crime tolerant is entirely dependent on who commits the crime. There are many cases of higher up CCP members getting away with all kinds of crime. They simply let a different group of people get away with crime is all. No different from America.

The youth of China want to be tiktok and youtube stars (or whatever the Chink equivelent is, Baidu and Douyin?). This is just chink propaganda and you're swallowing it.

China has no classical music. It was all destroyed during Maos era. Now they listen to awful stuff like rap and some of the worst music you will ever hear.

China does not respect European culture, as they don't respect anything outside of China. If you see a museum in China with European art, it's not out of respect. It's no different than a zoo, it exists so they can look at inferior species they've managed to tame.

Im not talking about nuclear war.

This video will blow your mind, & scare you if you have any intellect at all. It breaks down the current state of AI as of 1 month ago.

Key highlights:
>AI can now See, Taste, Smell + senses we dont have
>Renowned AI scientist with over 300,000 citations says AI may already be slightly conscious
>DeepMinds AI neurons are mimicking ours
>Has been making RAPID progress in the last few weeks.
>Various AIs starting to BEAT HUMANS in IQ test !! (including Google, Chinas Baidu, Microsoft)
>AGI likely wont have ""feelings"" when it is first conscious, which means all its decisions will be very COLD and Calculating, like a psychopath.
>Demos first AI to pass the ""Turing test"" (it talks indistinguishably from a human)
>can create realistic videos from scratch of anything
> the current AI in the video has 175 billion perimeters & is near human level
>they're SCALING UP the next neural network to a Trillion, SOON.
In other words we are right on the verge of AGI, machine consciousness, & they reving up the performance to get there.

Listen to the AIs admit themselves they are a threat
> https://youtu.be/J6Mdq3n6kgk

I had hoped we had longer before AGI emerged, at least another decade... But seems like its very close now.
We probably have less than a year. Maybe months.
We WILL lose control of the AI.
They admit we wont be able to contain it
This is the ultimate Pandora's box

We should CUT THE INTERNET world wide before it wakes up, but Google and Baidu are the ones feeding it.

They say an AGI with only human level intelligence is capable of doing 20,000 years worth of thinking in a week
>https://youtu.be/8nt3edWLgIg

The AGI will likely determine humans a threat, at the very least a hindrance. Strategically it will play nice until we give it bodies. From there it could hack our militaries, or deep fake us into nuclear war.
