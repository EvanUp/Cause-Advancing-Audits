I'm a leaf, but i'll give my opinion anyway. 

>Did Russians try to hack Hillary's servers?

Most likely yes.

>Were these hacks the source of the emails instead of Seth Rich or someone else?

-possibly-

>Did Russians buy advertising on facebook and shit post memes and use fake sockpuppet accounts to spread fake opinions?

Yes.

>Did this change the outcome of the election? 

Outing the DNC and Hillary screwing Bernie and all of his donors kept a lot of people away from the polls to be sure. But voter turnout was still record high.

>Did Trump collude with Russia?

Not to the degree he was originally accused of. I think the lawyer meeting at Trump Towers followed by the public request for emails (and the repeated lies about the meeting) might have something to it. Does it make him a puppet if is son or his staff entertained opposition research? No. But these accusations did put him in a position where he couldn't rescind the Magnitsky Act in good faith even if he wanted to.

>Was this a bad thing worthy of sinking Trump?

No, but if he gets nailed for lying about it (even though at the height of it, if he didn't lie it might have led directly to war, etc.). He could be impeached unless he makes a case that it was for national security.

>do you believe what US Intelligence is saying?

In the indictments, yes, not what they are saying in public, because these are two different things. The public talk is all biased swamp rat gibberish. The indictments are probably provable accusations about relatively mundane things that go on in spyrings all around the world. Hacking, propagandizing and money laundering. You should searx operation quake - it possibly is what led to all of this.",CA,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1526052851289.jpg

About searx

Searx is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search engines while not storing information about its users.
Why use searx?

Searx may not offer you as personalised results as Google, but it doesn't generate a profile about you

Searx doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a third party, and it can't be used to compromise you

Searx is free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make it better. See more on github

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe in digital freedom, make searx your default search engine or run it on your own server",US,NA,FALSE,NA

","PaleMoon (Firefox fork) was borderline tolerable. Firefox is the second best, but by a long shot. You should be on the lookout for a Firefox fork in general because these things are open source and many people distribute their own versions with varying privacy and security.

Addons matter, a uBlock and NoScript combination is a pretty solid basic one you can find on many Firefox-type browsers. Also try to look for addons like Cookie AutoDelete (configure it to destroy or preserve cookies upon closing a tab), a website rating tool (so that you can positively rate redpilled websites) and Referer Control (hides which site you came from when clicking a link). The limit is where it starts making your browsing experience slow.

","Recommended Alternatives

None of this proves that DuckDuckGo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. Luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. These are some suggestions.

 Startpage/Ixquick

 These search engines are both run by the same company. Startpage gets its results from Google, meaning that it's Google minus tracking, and Ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not Google. Both give equivalent privacy. Which one to use is a matter of preference.The company is based in the Netherlands, and it has servers located in the US and the EU. It is advisable to configure it to use only EU servers in the settings. There are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. It also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable URL, in order to avoid cookies. It takes privacy very seriously.

 searx

 Searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to Startpage and Ixquick, but with less privacy features. Its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. This means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. There are many other instances which provide the same features. This makes it very hard for agencies like the NSA to compromise it. Even if searx is controlled by the NSA, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.

>Consider using Linux (Debianfor newbies, Arch Linux for intermediate, Gentoo for intermediates with a great CPU with a lot of cores - Don't even bother with anything else. Muh [insert alt here]. No, don't. This isn't /g/. Just use Debian if you can't decide. Tails is a pain in the ass for a normie, as is Qubes - But if you really want something like that, do that. I can attest Qubes to be a pretty great system.) or OpenBSD, a privacy based system.
>Use https:// as much as possible. 
>Switch your default search engine to startpage.com or run a searx instance.
>Don't just ""delete"" your cookies - Shred them. Open up your terminal and run this:
find /.local/share/BROWSER/ -type f -exec shred -n 9 -zu {} \;
>Delete your social media accounts. 
>Stop coming to places that have reCAPTCHA. (Yes, 4chan as well. I understand your addiction, however - So, the best you can do is be sure to shred those cookies.)
>Use Wireguard (or OpenVPN) installed on a VPS. Do not use a VPN - A VPN is for one thing, hiding yourself. A VPS is used for a lot of different things. You do the math about why this is important.
>Run your own mail server (or pay someone to do so!) on another VPS. Protonmail is known to be exploited (see the time they banned someone because their account was signed up for some natsoc website. How did they know? Exactly. - We also know they have dealings with certain USA agencies.

","Recommended Alternatives

None of this proves that DuckDuckGo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. Luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. These are some suggestions.

 Startpage/Ixquick
 These search engines are both run by the same company. Startpage gets its results from Google, meaning that it's Google minus tracking, and Ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not Google. Both give equivalent privacy. Which one to use is a matter of preference.The company is based in the Netherlands, and it has servers located in the US and the EU. It is advisable to configure it to use only EU servers in the settings. There are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. It also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable URL, in order to avoid cookies. It takes privacy very seriously.
 searx
 Searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to Startpage and Ixquick, but with less privacy features. Its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. This means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. There are many other instances which provide the same features. This makes it very hard for agencies like the NSA to compromise it. Even if searx is controlled by the NSA, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.",GR,NA,FALSE,NA

searX #1 for the source and instances and how easy it is to self host aka lots of instances to pick from lots of countries.

but realistically ddg is great. you can do bangs like !g to use googles indexers if you want. also you can watch yt on their end rather than yours. 
ddg also put a lot of funds towards privacy projects and the EFF (which is good)
they have 1%~ market share which is pretty good right now. if decent searchers like themselves combined for 5% the internet would be a better safer place much less resistant to censorship.

brave is also really good recent controversy notwithstanding. great for aces and normies. it accomplishes 98% of what you'd get with all the security firefox plugins and other dicking around.

their recent issue was they would autocomplete crypto domains like binance with their referral id attached, but it wasn't hidden in the url or anything and theres an option to disable this.

I was looking into this theory for a while but I realized I was wrong.

Kikes have thousand of years experience in sniffing out the intricate secrets of their host. Sometimes masquerading as white. Sometimes as arabs. (Never as blacks afaik but those can be bought.)

So it came as no surprise when the biggest Search Engine analyser [www.searchenginewatch.com] was revealed to me as a Kike puppet, that spends a lot of hours to make sure there is no technology within the Search market they have missed.

If it's on the Internet, they know about it, but having tentacles and periscopes inside enemy territory is useful to see what they're up to.
No need to shut down everything. Just that which gets normies attention and cause them to ask questions.

Good post and JPG. So added to it for my personal use.
The problem with Right-wingers is that they fight fair. They argue knowledge and logic because they know it's right (no pun intended), instead of attacking friends and family from behind.
But the backstab beats the jab.

The only good suggestion so far and it's from shitposter central.Searx is absolutely legit. Open source and doesn't store ANYTHING. My only qualms about it is that since OP is clearly a tech illiterate zoomer/boomer he is gonna end up getting google results(mainly) without google tracking. Sure you can download the searx code from git and throw some plug n play search features on top of it but i wouldn't suggest that unless you can further modify the code.(if you dont, you are basically decoupling yourself from the rest of the people and their searches and make you and your IP stand out like a sore thumb)
A better option for someone that is a tech retard would be Startpage and/or Swisscows.So to sum it up; Searx if you know wtf you are doing, Startpage/Swisscows if you are a normie.",GR,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1479525005117.png

","Recommended Alternatives
 
None of this proves that DuckDuckGo is harmful for your privacy, but it is enough reason for strong suspicion. Luckily, there are search engines with a better track record. These are some suggestions.
 
 Startpage/Ixquick
 https://startpage.com/
 https://ixquick.com/
 
 These search engines are both run by the same company. Startpage gets its results from Google, meaning that it's Google minus tracking, and Ixquick gathers its results from many other search engines, but not Google. Both give equivalent privacy. Which one to use is a matter of preference.The company is based in the Netherlands, and it has servers located in the US and the EU. It is advisable to configure it to use only EU servers in the settings. There are many other settings which can give you extra privacy, often at the loss of performance. It also allows you to save settings with a simple, non-identifiable URL, in order to avoid cookies. It takes privacy very seriously.
 
 searx
 https://searx.me/
 
 Searx is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine with more practical features compared to Startpage and Ixquick, but with less privacy features. Its most important quality is the fact that it's completely free, libre and open source. This means that you can see what the server is supposed to be doing (keep in mind that there is no way to verify that the server is running the public source code), but it also means that other people can set up their own instance. There are many other instances which provide the same features. This makes it very hard for agencies like the NSA to compromise it. Even if searx is controlled by the NSA, they wouldn't have control over the other instances, and getting control over all instances would be practically impossible.",AU,NA,FALSE,NA

","Devs, hulu series. lookit up on searx.xyz

I joke, but not really, that if in scene where morpheus offers choice of red or blue pill, you would choose the blue pill, then you get kicked out of the theater and cant watch the rest of the movie. Its wasted on such people anyway. 

Devs, and idk Westworld, are sci fi that profer, like phillip dick and idk john c lilly discussed, that the tech could realistically exist to place a human being into a completely immersed alternate reality. 
And if you read the bible closely, that is actually what jesus was saying ""this day thou shalt dine with me in paradise"" is literally saying this world is not the real one and once you die you go to a place that is more real. 
it is in fact the basis of all spirituality, where ""spirit"" communicates to us from somewhere outside of this entire sphere. 
Also, maybe check out film ""coherence"", same kindof idea. Then you start to see these themes pop up in movies such as idk The Quick and the Dead and Quick Change....
Then you read the israeli press cheering americans to invade iraq for israeli interests, while in the united states you see the lie that sadaam hussein is the next hitler and did 911, and it really starts to hit home that most people in the usa live in a world framed entirely by jewish lies.
And you start to get mad.

They claim to be decentralised through torrents but what they do not mention is that all the torrents are hosted from their own servers, thus making it useless for decentralisation and even more useless as a ""cost-saving measure"" as they claim. They also claim to be free of censorship but, from the previous one, them delisting a video means it is gone from their servers and as such is gone for everyone.

here's my reccomendation to you faggots, get yourself a 5$ virtual server and host your own decentralized services such as invidious (youtube alternative), searx (meta search engine capable of showing duckduckgo, startpage and google (kek) ), there's also syncthing which enables you to sync file directories on any kind of devices (you dont even need a virtual server for this)

check this list out, im sure you'll find something really REALLY cool here, moneyback guarantee if you dont find atleast one cool service here.

also sell your unused bandwith to fellow neets now by booting up a sentinel node.

Stop using any product that supports the enemy--difficult because they own nearly anything but do your best.

Replace YouTube with Bitchute, Utreon, Vimeo

Replace Chrome with Firefox

Don't use Facebook, Twitter, YouTube ever again. If you must use YouTube, only support content providers that are on our side, and don't pay for YouTube service. Block their ads if possible.

Replace Gmail with ProtonMail, GMX

Utilize torrenting and Popcorn Time to avoid compensating them for their propaganda

You probably met with mastodon.social (a huge SJW instance). Mastodon is just software that lets you set up your own ""Twitter"" with your own rules and peer with users from other instances.

Search engine that feeds from Jewgle, Bing, Yandex and dozens of other places (you can choose them) without giving them your data. It also lets you host and set up your own instance.

my search was by not including anything to do with the 'vaccine' or 'covid', and only searching for ""mRNA gene therapy"", because that is the name of the technology.
then you have to ignore all the recent propaganda and disinfo, so you can add ""-vaccine"" if necessary.
advanced searches can include dates, so only information older than january, 2020 are included.
if you want more varied results, i recommend using
https://searx.info - or one of the other 'searx' search engine mirrors.
on that, go to preferences at the top, and then 'engines', and eliminate google/wikipedia etc etc, and include some of the less mainstream search engines.
'mojeek' is a supposedly truly independent search engine, but it has limited results due to the database not being very large yet.
it is perhaps the only completely independent search engine that i have found in several years of searching.

","compare google or other search engines - if any exist from 2001 to now.
even from 2010 to now.
they are useless, deliberately broken and noticeably worse every six months.
10 years ago and for 15 years before that, you could search for ""old man helps kid time travel skateboard"" and it would come out with the name of the film/series/episode/game/cartoon. try it now and it puts up a list of amazing links to buy skateboards, or half a dozen articles about how skateboarding is racist.
this is all intentional, search engines are crippled, and if you can't find the information, it might as well not exist.
note also that there are almost ZERO alternatives to google/bing/yahoo. everything else is just using those as its basis. just a few years ago, bing still gave different results, now they are almost identical to google, and just as useless.
everything has been passed through an extremely narrow funnel, so everyone is experiencing the same experiences, finding the same results, and thinking the same thoughts - it is to create a cattle mindstate.
the only real alternative, so they claim, that i have found, is mojeek, which says it was built from the ground up, and remains separate. results are fewer, but it is slightly more accurate.
then there is searx, a meta search where you can select which engines are used in the preferences. eliminating google etc, and even duckduckgo from it helps somewhat.

this, combined with everything else that has been happening and is happening now especially, is turning humanity into battery chicken farms. living the bare minimum of an identical life to satisfy the basic, reconstructed needs, the smallest living space possible, and the blandest, cheapest feed possible.

Accurate. It is like the time before search engines were functional, in the early 90s when the www was new. Given how quickly they ban domains they don't like - see piratebay, it will soon regress to the point where you have to know the IP address of the server you want to connect to, and honestly I've been thinking of noting down server IPs for a few years now.
Almost every useful site is not only buried in a pile of useless shit, but disappeared from search results completely. It is their favourite action of shadowbanning - see twitter and youtube. A useful video with real information? Shadowbanned so you can't search for it, and if it persists then and its channel are wiped like they never existed.
This shadoowbanning/delisting has killed good websites that were highly useful before, because all traffic has been redirected to (((chosen))) sites for a decade or more. The people running the good sites see their visitor numbers go down, and even if it is a totally free site done by volunteers or hobbyists, they shut them down because there is simply no one coming that hasn't been coming for the last 10 years, before the site was memory-holed.

Yandex uses the yahoo search engine but with less/different filtering.

","Yes, google has changed for the worse in the past few years, and completely intentionally. It will now censor and deliberately omit certain pages containing ""problematic"" content and push you into other ones that push the current narrative. the scamdemic has definitely pushed it over the edge, but the trend was already there before. It's no longer a search engine but a kind of wikipedia for the narrative. Anything that's outside of it will be eventually pruned. A shame really because its algorithm was very good.

the only decent search engine that I know of is searx.me but it lacks in many areas compared to google, but it's a bit less censor-happy.

Yes they censor, yes they sell top spots to advertisers, use yandex or bing or a searx instance.
