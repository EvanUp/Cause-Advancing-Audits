They have proven to encourage censorship, encourage the breakdown of real life relationships, they have proven to spy on their users, & they have proven to encourage & give a platform to pedophiles. They're our modern day 1984 totalitarian complete government & corporate control.
We need to complete the paradigm & destroy the reputation of Facebook. We must make it look old, out of date, something no one uses, what ask.com, AIM became, & myspace became: irrelevant & an afterthought.
Mark Zuckerberg does not care about his users, he does not think about them, all he does is try & see the quickest way to make money: at the expense of your privacy.

Use these points to tell people who still use Facebook:

Their search engine fucking blows. I have to go to duckduckgo or yandex or bing or ask.com (RIP jeeves) just to search normal shit I usually got top results for on google. I have to dig to page 6 just to get anything relevant on Google. And their google images are brainlet tier bullshit. Search for ""dog""? Hurr get lots of pictures of Trump's face on a dog's body. Search for ""hitler""? Hurr get lots of pictures of Trump. Search for space? Hurr get lots of pictures of Trump being anally probed. You get the picture.

Their email fucking sucks. Nothing that protonmail can't do 100 times better. And they recently launched a new visual format that makes me reminisce of the days of the digg v3 exodus, when users CARED. This kind of bullshit Google is pulling with their mail should be launching mass exoduses right now! But why aren't they? I'll get to that.

Their ad system fucking sucks too now. Not only are tons of people blocking the ads, they're also using adNauseum, causing a lot of ad data from Google to be garbage data.

Let's not even get started on the captcha and how much that fucking sucks and how painfully obvious it's some shit recognition system for their AI cars. 

Google's only worth right now is in their AI labs which only the beneficiaries of Google get to peek at and enjoy the fruits of.

Only reason people are still using Google is because it has a monopoly. And by its own merit, Google should NOT have a monopoly. It SUCKS, and the only reason it does is its historical advantage. Now it is time for it to be destroyed and replaced.
