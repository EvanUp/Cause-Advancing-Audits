Here are some arguments:
Your first source of 'evidence':
1. Link to a tweet of Tom Scott, one which has been followed up by the Brave team and fixed. The project is new and you can't do everything right in one go, but they fix critique and that is just so conveniently not included. Pic related. This is over 2 years ago.

2. The other argument is about how you need to KYC to withdraw your BAT, which is due to law restrictions. Opting into the BAT rewards program is completely your own choice - you don't HAVE to - so this is a complete non-argument.

Your second source of 'evidence': 
1. They identify auto-updates as evidence that it's spyware... completely lacking any foundation whatsoever. In fact, forcing auto-updates on your users might prevent them from never updating and running into security risks.

2. ""Google is default"" - You get the option to choose during setup. Besides, Brave is working on their own privacy-aimed search engine called ""Brave Search"" which will from that point on out become the default selected.

3. Telemetry setting is unchecked during setup and transparantly asked for.

4. The rest is just a bunch of nonsense about requests the browser makes without showing any sensitive data in payloads etc.

So as I said: A lot of FUD nonsense.",NA,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1621935963783.jpg

It is characterized by bubbling as it leaves the anus and can make one wonder if they have experienced a shart (a combination of a fart and a small amount of fecal matter). This type of fart is typically associated with inopportune moments and may be coupled with a sneeze.

However, since the context does not contain enough information to accurately answer the user query, it’s advised to use Brave Search to find more information about “fart fanoogin” if necessary.

Here is what brave search shit out: The size of a nuclear weapon that can produce a significant electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is typically in the range of 1 to 10 megatons (4.2 to 42 PJ) during Cold War planning for EMP attacks. This is roughly 50 to 500 times the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Physicists have testified that weapons with yields of 10 kilotons (42 TJ) or less can also produce a large EMP. The area affected by a high-altitude EMP can be as large as the size of Nebraska or larger, potentially disrupting or damaging unprotected electronic devices. However, the range of non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) weapons is much less than nuclear EMP, and their effects are limited to a smaller area.

It mentions 10 kilotons as having a 'large' effect but I wager the reference to one the 'size of Nebraska' was for something in the aforementioned 1-10 megaton range. So as a show of force I'm sure it could be relatively small, probably even enough to emp a sprawling facility.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

perhaps would be more sustainable with more military activity. ""kicking the can"" would be a lot easier with war revenue to back it up. i agree with you that printing has caused a lot of damage, but we printed the most money after we ended the main forever war rather than before.
