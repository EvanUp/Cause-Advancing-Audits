You could use fake facebook profiles to gather farm friends.
Once in the friend network you could use facebook api to get info on all the friends in the network.
Then you could filter the dataset for females that have kids and are not engaged.
Most of them would probably have in their own info that they are single and that they have a kid if not you need the next step.
In the last step and most difficult you could technically use some neural network/machine learning to gather the information, for example sampling the photos, detecting faces, knowing who appear, if the owner of the profile appears with a kid in most photos, etc.

That's exactly how facebook process their own data and how third parties non-aligned with facebook use it to gather information.",AR,NA,FALSE,NA

","I recently graduated a coding school that only teaches you coding; costs nothing upfront; doesn't even do student loans and instead uses income share agreements that basically say that if Lambda (my school) doesn't land me a job making 75k or more per year, they don't get paid for teaching me. Kikes are all screaming their fucking heads off trying to get this new type of higher education shut down so that (((student loans))) keep being taken out, and (((gender study holocaust class))) is filled with impressionable debt slaves. 

It took me 1 year and 2 months to finish school. I was hired within 2 weeks of looking for a job, making 85k as a fullstack webdev lead. 

My five year plan involves buying a missile silo converted into a house-bunker and buying land along highways to put my own redpill billboards up. I also had planned to spend a fuckton of money fucking over my exwife in custody court but she just gave up as soon as my lawyer served her the paperwork lmao
I also buy about two or three upscale white prostithots per month now, on the recommendation from a colleague. It's great. Life is great. Coding is great. 
 
If just 100 anons do as I have done, we could show the rest of you brainlets how very fragile the kike net of web censorship really is.

Trust.txt is a simple page of code with the goal that it would be used worldwide to distinguish legitimate news organizations from non-legitimate ones.

>The idea of having a universal code that achieves mass adoption by digital platforms is not a new one. Back as early as 1994, before the internet reached widespread use, a company called Nexor initiated the robots.txt reference document to aid early search engines, like WebCrawler, Lycos and AltaVista, to crawl and index page contents correctly within any Website. Today it is estimated that over 90% of global sites have this file placed within their route directory that anyone can see (https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt, https://www.cnn.com/robots.txt ). Just a few years ago, the ads.txt file was created by The Internet Advertising Bureau to assist online buyers with fraud detection.

>Now comes Scott Yates, a lifelong journalist and entrepreneur. In the past three years, he has devoted most of his time and energy establishing JournalList.net with a mission to introduce and promote the adoption of a new reference document —Trust.txt. This is a file that news publishers will add to their websites to signal their affiliations with other trusted news organizations.

>In this 102nd episode of “E&P Reports,” Publisher Mike Blinder speaks with JournalList.net founder and Executive Director Scott Yates about their mission to have the Trust.txt reference document adopted and utilized by journalistic sites worldwide as a means to establish their authority as a trusted, credible, legitimate news outlet.",US,6,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1631717026662.png

","eventually they'll be destroying Taiwan and then claiming that multicore, fast processors are ""strategic assets"" that require a license and are subject to limits on how many you can own
The limitation right now is not your processing power per se, but your dataset
Right now in your garage you could probably get 70-80% close to the functionality of ChatGPT on your own, if you were willing to dump $40-50k into hardware and pay $4,000/mo in electricity. 

The only difference between you and OpenAI aside from manpower and cash is:
>contracts and agreements with Google, Reddit, MSFT that give you open access to ungodly amounts of tagged data to train your model on, either in bulk, or through their APIs

Once the open source community figures out how to use a webcrawler to tag data with machine learning and do semi-supervised learning with an AI model by just using wget to spam servers, it's over for consumer AI because they'll ban that shit (both the hardware and software) immediately",US,NA,FALSE,NA
