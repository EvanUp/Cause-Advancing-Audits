Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.

Nor is mould like should and would.
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.

When you correctly say croquet,
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.
Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
And enamour rhyme with hammer.
River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
Doll and roll and some and home.
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.

Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
And then singer, ginger, linger,
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.
Query does not rhyme with very,
Nor does fury sound like bury.
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
Though the differences seem little,
We say actual but victual.
Refer does not rhyme with deafer.

>MOSCOW, April 29. /TASS/. 
>(Pro tip, petal. That's today)
>The Russian telecom regulator Roskomnadzor is improving tools for Telegram messenger blocking, press service of the authority told TASS.

""Roskomnadzor is improving on a daily basis tools making it possible to perform the court decision on limiting of access to Telegram in the territory of Russia,"" the press service said.

The comment was made in return to comments of the professional community criticizing methods of messenger blocking, which led to failures in operation of certain websites and services.
Roskomnadzor has not prepared appropriately for the large-scale blocking and does not use existing modern methods to comply with laws, ICT expert Ilya Massukh said earlier.

According to deputy head of the regulator Vadim Subbotin, more advanced methods indeed exist but they are not suitable to limit operations of messengers. 
All the mobile messengers operate now using IP address changing systematically, the official said.
On April 13, Moscow’s Tagansky Court satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to block access to the Telegram instant messaging service in Russia due to its failure to provide the keys for decrypting users’ messages to the Federal Security Service (FSB). 
On April 16, communication providers embarked on carrying out the blocking process.",AU,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1524980388413.jpg

You will need the following items for this spell: 

3 black candles 
1 small bowl 
Water (preferably from a natural river) 
Quill and red ink (or a red pen) 
1 small piece of paper 
1 rose 
Lavender 
Jasmine Oil

This has a greater chance of working when done in the presents of a full moon. This does however, NEED to be done at night. The closer to midnight the last step is done, the more effective this spell shall be. This spell also isnt guarenteed to kill the person, but even if it doesnt, the person will experiance some sort of pain or suffering, be it emotionally, mentally or indeed physically. It is recommended that you get as much sleep as possible before casting this spell. This is so you can rest your mind and regain your energy, which is vital for this spell. I also recommend you sleep because you may not get very many hours of sleep whilst casting this spell. Light your 3 candles. Place two either side of you, and one in front of you. Place the bowl of water in between you and the candle in front of you, and place your quill, ink, paper, rose, lavender and jasmine oil in between you and the bowl. Make sure you are in a quiet, dark area. Meditate in this layout until you have cleared your mind. This will help you focus on the spell. Once you have finished your meditation, anoint your forehead, throat, heart, abdomen and feet, and sit in the lotus position (if you weren't already). Pick up your quill and dip it in your ink (or just take your red pen). Picture the person you wish death upon, and write their full birth name on the paper (the name written on their birth certificate). Pick up your rose. Pick off the petal furthest away from you, and rub the name you have written on the paper with it. (PLEASE MAKE SURE that the ink is dry, even if you used a pen. Smudging the name can be a serious danger, and can cause the spell to backfire, which can result in terrible things.) (con't)",NA,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1530143526076.jpg

In The Inner Reaches Of Outer Space, Joseph Campbell discusses the similarity between the Babylonian and Genesis flood stories. In the Babylonian story, there were ten kings who lived very long lives from the creation to the time of the flood -- a period of time given as 432,000 years. Zecharia Sitchin reckons the time frame to be 445,000 years ago, with the flood pegged at 13,000 years ago. [1] (Do the math.)

In the Biblical account, there were ten patriarchs between Adam and Noah (aka The Adam's Family), who also lived long lives. The total years -- adjusting for the massive overlap in their lives, add up to 1,656. In that number of years, there are 86,400 weeks, or exactly twice 43,200. Curiously, the number of seconds in a 24 hour day is 86,400.

To reconcile taking half of 86,400 to obtain 43,200, one should note the ancient tradition of seeing a cycle as one half waning and one half waxing (as in the lunar cycle). The day thus has 24 hours, or 2 sets of 12 hours -- 12 hours of a waxing sun, followed by 12 hours of a waning sun. 12 is, in fact, considered the celestial holy number (7 being the down-to-earth holy number). Additionally, in Revelation 12, the woman with child has a crown of 12 stars. The New Jerusalem has 12 gates, angels and pearls. And the symbol of the Heart chakra is a 12-petal Lotus Flower . John Mitchell, author of City Of Revelation, shows a diagram of the New Jerusalem Plan, based on St. John’s vision. It has 12 circles in a ring, with a 12-pointed star inside, formed by four overlapping triangles. (The Zodiac is often depicted in a similar way). If you take the circles to be 360 degrees each, and multiplies by the number of circles, the total equals 4,320.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

I test drove one and it was indeed a nice bike and the motor function worked great. He pitched it as a petal bike with the option of battery power if you were going up a steep hill or just got tired and wanted a break. Who knows some folks may never push the petals?

4chan has everything it actually need to be considered an occult organization.

See for example one of old 4chan memes ""Moon man"" wich started as trolling making an old McDonald propaganda into a racist symbol. Moon man have connections with an old esoteric belif called theosophy and the idea of old groups of ascendend being giving knowledge to humanity.

","Something is surely being lost in translation, because I doubt any of the men are virgins. Maybe a fraction of 1% are.
They also have a humility thing where they will feel the need to lie in order to spare the person asking the question from receiving an unnecessarily truthful answer that might make the questioner uncomfortable about his own life. 100% of Japanese do this. So the question itself can't even really be reliably asked to anyone.
Japanese have no incentive to enter a real relationship. The men there can be fully sexually satisfied by women without ever entering a relationship.
For instance, Japan has blowjob bars everywhere. ""Pinsaros"".
You go in, buy a drink, and get a tender and loving blowjob from the beautiful young loli server. No condom. She has this down to a science in the way you can only expect from the Japanese. She'll make you feel pleasure you didn't know your body was even capable of experiencing.
Or if you really want to treat yourself, you order the ""flower petal rotation"" where three girls rotate through taking turns blowing you until you cum.
You just sit back and enjoy watching them suck your dick and listening to their cute squeaks. Colorful lights flash around you and the thumping uplifting trance music plays. They swallow and gently clean the dribbled sperm off your tummy afterwards.
And from your post, I can tell you have barely even scratched the surface of their porn. Keep your language set to Japanese and you can find really nasty videos on DMM. My favorite are the ones where three girls are working together on a man in the following fashion: One is gently sucking his dick, one is gently licking his anus, and one is gently rubbing his nuts and tummy. All are very convincingly uttering moans of joy just from the happiness they're feeling by making the man feel pleasure. There are thousands of videos of variations this exact scenario.

Hosemann was born in Vicksburg in western Mississippi. He received his Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1969 from the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. In 1972, he earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Mississippi School of Law in Oxford, Mississippi. In 1973, he obtained specialization in Taxation at New York University. Hosemann currently lives in the capital city of Jackson, where he is a partner with Phelps Dunbar LLP.[1]

Secretary of State
In the general election on November 6, 2007, Hosemann defeated the Democrat Robert Smith in the race for Secretary of State.[2] In the Republican primary election on August 7, 2007, Hosemann received 54 percent of the vote, defeating former mayor of Columbus Jeffrey Rupp and State Representative Mike Lott of Petal. He took office in January 2008, succeeding Democrat Eric Clark. During the campaign, he took advantage of his unusual name in order to gain name recognition. A series of commercials showed an elderly woman talking about the good things he would do as Secretary of State, meanwhile forgetting his name as he tried to correct her. She typically used similar names such as Gilbert, Albert, Philbert, Dilbert, and Herbert. Since then, various public service messages, such as a reminder to go vote during election season, have included this format, the woman talking about the importance of voting, then mispronouncing Hosemann's name, then Hosemann correcting her and continuing the reminder.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

YOUR DAILY ARYAN WORKSHOP HOW TO LOVE GOD !

Today we need to really start a series on VEDIC COSMOLOGY ! Earth is flat and round like a lotus petal. It is the best middle ground between the round and flat concepts . There are some aspects of earth we just can’t see and can be observed from demigods perspective.

>All the planets are here described as gola, round. Every planet is round, and each planet is a different shelter, just like islands in the great ocean. Planets are sometimes called dvīpa or varṣa. This earth planet is called Bhārata-varṣa because it was ruled by King Bharata. Another significant word used in this verse is bahv-āścaryam, “many wonderful things.” This indicates that the different planets are distributed all over the universe in the eight directions, and each and every one of them is wonderful in itself. Each planet has its particular climatic influences and particular types of inhabitants and is completely equipped with everything, including the beauty of the seasons. In the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.40) it is similarly stated, vibhūti-bhinnam: on each and every planet there are different opulences.

My dear Madhava,
Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd Sept. 1976 and have noted the contents. Regarding details of the universe, be satisfied by reading only Bhagavatam. What is the use of reading other books—you are not going there. Some portion of the earth is flat. When you stand in any place you see flat, so for us to some extent it appears flat, but it is round.
Simply keep faith that whatever we describe, that is a fact. After all, we are an insignificant creature in the universe, so whether you take the modern scientists or Sukadeva Goswami, it is inconceivable. It is best to keep faith in Sukadeva Goswami, because actually our only business is to go back to home, back to Godhead. So whether Sukadeva Goswami or the modern scientists are right or wrong, it is nothing interesting to us. We want to go back to home, back to Godhead—yanti mad-yajino'pi mam.
I hope this meets you in good health.
Your ever well-wisher,
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

See. Your problem is that you don’t know but you think you know. Everything is simply proven till you truthfully start doing scientific experiments and finding out so many anomalies within either round or flat concepts. 

KRISHNA and Demigods are the best authorities on the subject matter. They say Earth portion we see is like a LOTUS PETAL.

Their ""truth"" will have you believing that you are a useless spec of dust. You feel that in your heart, and that *truth* exhibits itself in your actions every day, rather than the real *truth*. You are god, meeting god in every move, and you reality will reflect your positive and negative decisions in a very real way.

peterson is effectively falling into this role too. he started with a good premise and decent ideas, but he is surrounded by fanboys and sycophants and so is being guided by feedback into saying what the crowd wants to hear. he even says himself that he can see the reactions of the crowd when he says something that has impact. he is searching for those moments.
he used to be a man under attack and is now a man on a petal stool, and he wants to continue on that trajectory.

On these four mountains there are trees a banyan tree. There are also lakes full of milk, honey, sugarcane juice and pure water. These lakes can fulfill all desires. There are also gardens named Nandana, Citraratha, Vaibhrājaka and Sarvatobhadra. On the side of Supārśva Mountain is a kadamba tree with streams of honey flowing from its hollows, and on Kumuda Mountain there is a banyan tree named Śatavalśa, from whose roots flow rivers containing milk, yogurt and many other desirable things. Surrounding Sumeru Mountain like filaments of the whorl of a lotus are twenty mountain ranges such as Kuraṅga, Kurara, Kusumbha, Vaikaṅka and Trikūṭa. To the east of Sumeru are the mountains Jaṭhara and Devakūṭa, to the west are Pavana and Pāriyātra, to the south are Kailāsa and Karavīra, and to the north are Triśṛṅga and Makara.

The reality is , it is inconceivable to our mental ability to understand the shape of the earth.

It does when you do the actual physics of it. .45 weighs more and has more muzzle velocity. Doing the math a ""punch"" from a .45 vs a 9mm is pretty significant different. Mass + velocity and all that. Now where your 9mm comes in is that a .45 might just be powerful enough to just punch right through the whole body, but a 9mm might have the sweet spot of being stopped by the body, transferring all of its energy into the subject, creating a more relative punch. It all depends on how far away the target is. Plus if you're using hollow points.

You fail to understand, as do so many, the difference between politeness and deference.

We did not raise a world-spanning empire because we're little nice people. What we are, is private. There's 60 million of us, rammed into a tiny little island. We've had to learn to be polite to each other, because we live in each other's pockets half the time.

Doesn't mean we're not still completely capable of fucking you up. It's like when you end a game of Monopoly, or Risk - you put the pieces back in the box so everyone else gets to have a turn. Then you have all the fun of beating them again.

The world speaks English, you cretinous shitbag. It's the new /lingua franca/ - the language of aviation and shipping and trade. All the other languages are dying out and being replaced, because they're mostly shonky and shit.

He’s floating in front of your face, eyes wide and getting wider, stretching beyond what’s possible. His form twists and wanes with the peaks of your psychic rapture. You feel all twenty-five microtoes prod your bottom lip to open your mouth. He dances upon your teeth to the rhythm of the eternal hymn, Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind. Its pop sensibilities radiate from your thousand-petal crown, Sahasrara, shooting modern rock vibrations deep inside your quivering root, Muladhara. His tinny laugh, five octaves higher than Stephan Jenkins’ mellifluous brocals, awakens you from this sonic bliss.

“Can you hear it, novitiate?” He speaks to you tenderly. “Do you hear His celestial wailing?”

“And the riffing!” You exclaim, eager to impress your teacher. He smiles warmly.

“You are yet a suckling, and you wish to impress me?”

“Yes, teacher. Just tell me what I must do to gain your favor.”

His Shapeet stop tapping. The healing tones of America’s favorite San Francisco-based post-grunge quartet vanish. It doesn’t take long for human frailty to find you.

In fact, I had an existential crisis. The Los Alamos National Laboratory manuscript pointed towards R0 as 6.6, and University of Georgia and Kyoto University as 7.0. These R0 values are impressive, and deserve respect. Smallpox, for example, had a roughly 6-7 R0 value and decimated the Native American population with a 25-50% mortality rate. 

HMMP you say - 50% mortality rate is far higher than COVID-19. Yes, with hospitalization, COVID-19 has a 5-15% mortality rate, according to multiple reports, including the Chinese CDC. This is fine, you say - but when the critical illness rate of as high as 25%, and a lack of ""self healing"", and more dangerous with subsequent infections makes COVID-19 a respectable virus. In fact, with the 14-24 day asymptomatic incubation period, COVID-19 will give Smallpox a run for its money. The 1918 Spanish Flu is no where near as potent as COVID-19. 

Even in confined quarters, the 1918 Spanish Flu had a mere 4.0 R0, and just a 4 day incubation period. 

One would be fortunate should this virus mutate into one as ""mild"" as the 1918 Spanish Flu. 

Why do I wish COVID-19 well? The answer is simple: for far too long our species has become complacent with the status quo. Since WW2, we have been ""petal to the metal"", exploiting as much as possible as rapidly as possible to get our grubby hands on as many ""shiny things"" as we possibly could. Our species has taken zero measures to ""slow down"" our status quo, and literally every single decision that has been collectively made over the past 150 years was designed to maximize the status quo.

>plebbit tourists who run Facebook meme pages latched onto this, and started assuming that the word ""booglaoo"" itself meant a new civil war- primarily against the red flag laws and other gun control efforts that many states, such as Virginia, were trying to implement about a year ago

I live in Ottawa too, and grew up in rural Ontario. I'm not attending this protest for the same reason I don't attend or partake of Conservative, or any politics. I'm working. 

I know that the countryside where I grew up is as Blue as Alberta is. I grew up surrounded by farmers and mechanics and tradesmen. I also know that under the current political system, those people are kept far away from the Laurentians domination over the politics. And these people are the most insufferable of the insufferable, because my mothers side of the family is literally ""them"". 

I hope for Alberta to leave, if nothing else than to stop them from being held hostage by the Communists in Quebec, the backdoor through which all of socialism has crept into this country. I know, I lived in Quebec during the Bill 101 act. They are not Canadians. Not by any measure.

I want things to turn around, but the only thing I have to lose is everything to the lunatics that infect every facet of my life. I wish I was living parallel to the system but circumstances dictate that I live in it.

These radio/micro EMFs also interact specifically with larger macromolecules, essentially adding energy to metabolic pathways in way that disrupts homeostasis. Imagine if the pistons in a car receive different ratios of fuel/air injections at random intervals when a car is driving, pretend this only happens when driving an incline, the greater the gradient, the more frequent an unbalanced fuel/air mixture is injected. So the longer you drive on inclined areas, the faster your engine wears out. The hill is the cell towers, the car is your body, the engine is your cells, the pistons are the enzymes of your metabolic pathways, and the fuel/air ratio is the catalysts and metabolites/reactants.

Some of his ideas like “work 2 jobs through college and don’t go unless you pay in cash” are unrealistic and I disagree with.

Some more tips:
If you don’t have a CC don’t go to your bank for a “secured” card. Its basically a fake CC you have to pay a deposit for which is stupid. Apply for the Petal card instead, they don’t check your credit.

Rewards are generally not worth it. People will brag about the flights etc they earned etc but they won’t admit how much they rang up or what the yearly fees are for those cards. Get a basic 2% cash back no fee card like Citi doublecash.

A credit card is money you are borrowing. Do not think its any differently. Its NOT for emergencies because when it comes time to pay the bill you won’t have the money and will be hit with a 25% interest fee.

Abandoned unconscious to pleasure, I soon forced myself to bring a firm hand to its source to seize, in the middle of the lint, a small tuft of living hair. Phew, phew, retrospective shame might silence me but I owe my reader. It was her little dog licking the back of my scrotum with his feverish, scratchy tongue. What can I say? What to do? The girl, whose buttocks came and went in front of me like English pudding, had already gone too far to be interested in anything but her elusive pleasure. So I put the innocent little beast back on the ground, which immediately resumed its task.

Rose petal, dog show. Dare I admit it? We played at the same time, her alone, me with the dog. A young, three-year-old, virgin male Yorkie named Poupeto.

Poupeto mi corazon, with a rough tongue and velvet eyes! I never knew if you had been trained in this exercise by a perverse loser, or if this surge of love had come to you instinctively.

Allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take science rockets to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax.

Let's take a closer look
A bit of context: Guadalupe is most likely Spanish trying to write Nahualt word 'coatlaxopueh' = ""the one who tramples the snake""
A young Indian man had a vision of Mary and she told him to gather flowers in his garment, he found the flowers though they didn't bloom in that time of year and brought them to the priest. When he unraveled the garment the picture was on it.
On the picture Mary is shown without a mask, in Aztec art deities were drawn with masks, showing she isn't a deity, yet she stands upon the moon (deity in Aztec religion) and is clothed in stars
A woman higher than deities?
Mary has a black cloth tied around belly, in Aztec culture it signified pregnancy, yet she has her hair loose: symbol of virginity
A pregnant virgin?
On her dress, in the place uterus is, she has four-petal flower
This flower was in Aztec culture symbol of complete perfection, highest divinity
A pregnant virgin carrying the God, Lord of Universe in her womb?
Aditionally in that region they make the clothes of material that gets easily destroyed with time",PL,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1605450796154.jpg

Sure thing wagie. Except I'm obviously the educated authority on this matter, which is why you haven't formulated an opinion on it.

Social Credit will flood the OnlyFans accounts of the Thot-caste as you pick up trash on the side of the road, occasionally splashed by oily-muddy puddles while the cars of the elite deemed worthy by the Central Authority pass by.

But you, dear wagie, will not own a car. You will deemed ""dirty"" by the Social Credit system and will be blamed for Global Climate Change. ""If only those wagies didn't consume so much"", the Thot-caste will say, as they twiddle their twats for a twitter of social media follows and gain even more Social Credit wealth. You, wagie, will only own a cuckbike. A small bike that barely seats you, with a structure so tight that your one-piece muddy wagie uniform gets stuck in the gears every quarter mile. Better petal fast wagie, or you'll miss your half-a-credit bonus, which you'll need if you want to remain in the Sewage Treatment Basement Complex, rather than being downgraded to The Hole where all the Social Credit failures who do the dirty work of society stay.

Keep dreaming Wagie. Have hope. Maybe one day, a Social Credit Thot will lean out her window and spit 10 stories down onto you. A thot's spit can sell for at least 20 credits, don't you know. That's almost a month's salary for you. Dream big wagie. Dream big.",US,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1426390785415.jpg

>This issue of JAMA contains yet another study, and certainly among the best published to date, demonstrating the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study, from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PETAL Clinical Trials Network, focused on hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease. In this well-conducted, appropriately powered clinical trial, the authors randomized 479 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n=242) or placebo (n=237). The trial was stopped early at the fourth interim analysis for futility. For the primary outcome, clinical status at 14 days measured on a 7-category ordinal scale, there was no significant difference between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [interquartile range {IQR}] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73-1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups, including mortality at 28 days: 10.4% in the hydroxychloroquine group vs 10.6% in the placebo group (absolute difference, −0.2% [95% CI, −5.7% to 5.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). Thus, the results conclusively show no benefit of hydroxychloroquine over placebo.

","Not in .22 LR, against human targets, except possibly if you can only get round-nose and you know you're firing out of rifle-length barrel at close range. You can buy hollow points (designed to expand) and segmented (designed to split apart) .22 LR ammo off the shelf.

Segmented is good for varmints, greatly reducing penetration depth (which you don't need as much of in a small animal), in exchange for cutting multiple wound tracks, making a badly-placed shot more likely to be fatal anyway. Hollow point is designed for controlled expansion, which does enhance the terminal effect, provided the bullet is going fast enough for the impact to cause the expansion to happen, and the bullet can still penetrate deeply enough after expanding.

Out of a pistol, .22 hollow point won't expand (because it's going slower and so doesn't slap the target as fiercely), and you wouldn't want it to. You're struggling to get enough penetration depth. A half-assed modification of a bullet to try and make it expand more like cutting a cross on the tip is probably going to make it unstable in flight, and might screw up its ability to penetrate sufficiently.

Usually a ""flower petal"" bullet is jacketed, with the copper jacket holding the bullet together as the petals fold out. Lead is a much weaker metal, and .22 LR bullets don't have copper jackets (though they sometimes have a very thin ""copper wash""), so trying to recreate the same effect probably makes bullets that break apart into smaller pieces that don't get very far into the target.",CA,NA,FALSE,NA

Well, some will say no because they do not speak a slavic language. However, their art and style will wonderfully merge with the slavic style (e.g. colors, petal patterns). I have come to met some Afghans after the massive immigration. Many of them look familiar at face value. They have a strict set of moral conduct rules like the Slavs, are very combatant, value family, are rebellious and organize themselves in a tribal way. So, as an Afghan you will generally earn a “you know, you give me the feeling like if I knew you already” from a Slav. From that I conclude that Afghans are a remote branch of Slavs but I cannot explain the differences in the language.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

 All right, so just before I got the damn thing, I was doing some meditation. The kind with roots out of your root Chakra and a lotus opening on your crown. Except this time I invited the kundalini serpent to stretch out and bite the back of my head. Instead of a many petal lotus blossom opening on my Crown Chakra, I saw instead it grow into a tall bish that produced a brightly glowing seed, which after a while I plucked from it's stalk.
 I wanted to keep it, but there aren't exactly pockets in the astral realm so I ate it, where it seems to remain in my chest.
 Now I have been looking for an explanation for this visualization and have not found it. I'm curious as to the significance of it if any. I think in this time of duress I made a sort of 'backup copy' of my soul as it is to rely on, since I knew I was being forced to take this anti christ devil snake venom.

","I didn't.
Coming for my job, what else could I do but reveal my power level? One way or the other, I'm pretty jawesome.
I can do more damage to society of I can operate without crippling blood clots.
But the real reason I'm responding, is because I want answers.
This is some /x/ tier stuff, and I want answers, I'm not interested in giving them or explaining further.
All right, so just before I got the damn thing, I was doing some dilation. The kind with roots out of your root Shakira and a scrotus opening on your boipucci. Except this time I invited the gandalfini serpent to stretch out and dilate the back of my mangina. Instead of a many petal scrotus blossom opening on my Shakira, I saw instead it grow into a tall benis that produced a brightly glowing seed, which after a while I sneeded from it's stalk.
I wanted to keep it, but there aren't exactly hot pockets in the astral realm so I ate it, where it seems to remain in my toally beminine chest.
Now I have been looking for like 5 minutes for an explanation for this visualization and have not found it. I'm curious as to the significance of it if any. I think in this time of duress I made a sort of 'backup copy' of my sneed as it is to rely on, since I knew I was being forced to take this anti chrissy venom.
If someone better learned in gandalfini could give me some perspective, I have some good boy points I could give you.",NA,NA,FALSE,NA

","I think I understand your point, but I think it’s more about spirit. Hardcore punk had a hardcore spirit, a hardcore combatant ethos. Same with what we used to just call hardcore, which was basically punk/metal without the typical (and limiting) punk beat on drums and without typical metal melody histrionics (see Metallica, etc). The driving force was simply FUCK YOU and you had to be ready to get a dose of FUCK YOU, live and in person. Personally, regardless of details like OMG distortion petal, or OMG marshall half stack, or OMG punks using razors to slice speakers in no-name shit quarter stacks to get the vibe right, the thing was you being you.

90s commercial punk was (((our favorite people))) hijacking yet another cultural phenomena. It has no relation to the underground current of hardcore (including hardcore punk) which dates to the 70s and was mutating in great directions until suffocated by (((who)))",US,NA,FALSE,NA

Okay but seriously, the intensity of the quakes is worrying. At the start no quakes reached 4 magnitude. Then they started reaching that magnitude, but were very deep quakes (30km+).
Now the 4.0 quakes occur more frequently AND they've risen in depth, being at around 15km.

",">Two that went by color-coded names are Dr. Green (Joseph Mengele a.k.a. Angel of Death) and Dr. Gruenbaum, who collaborated w/ Nazis during WW2 – Dr. Josef Mengele, whose trademark of cold blooded, calculating brutality has not only scarred souls of survivors from Auschwitz, but countless number of victims throughout the world. Mengele’s direct involvement at Auschwitz concentration camp was downplayed during Nuremberg Trials, and consequently no intensified effort by U.S. and it’s allies was directed toward his capture…not surprising! To confuse investigators as to his whereabouts, U.S. officials would report Mengele being a non-threatening recluse in Paraguay or Brazil, or that he was simply dead (the “Angel of Death” miraculously must have come back to life at least five different times). His unprecedented research, at the expense of thousands of lives, undoubtedly was a significant bonus to U.S. interests. Besides using the pseudonym of Dr. Green, survivors knew him as Vaterchen (daddy), Schoner Josef (beautiful Joseph), David and Fairchild. A gracefully handsome man of slight stature, Mengele would disarm people with his charming demenor, then explode into violent rages. Other characteristics remembered by survivors were the cadence of his shiny black boots as he paced back and forth and his “I-love-you, l-love-you-not” daisy game. When he pulled off the last daisy petal, he would maliciously torture and kill a small child in front of the other child he was programming. Distraught survivors also recalled being thrown naked into cages with monkeys sexual attacking them. Evidently, Mengele enjoyed reducing people to the level of animals. He also would purposely restrain his victims from crying, screaming, or showing any excessive emotion",BR,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1635632294398.png

That sounds nice. Truth is that I have never used the metro or a rail since where I live isn't big enough to need them.

How gay. What happens if you try to access a blocked site? Do you simply get a page telling you that the site is banned (like in some workplaces and public networks here), or does something ""more serious"" happen?
