is youtube a public utility? Should it be regulated by government? Should the free market fix by offering a solution? Will the crony capitalist cartel laden atmosphere allow for true free market? 

2. Free Market will decide. If your not already, Boycott all google sites. So use QWANT.COM and DUCKDUCKGO.COM for searches and for videos Break.com , Vimeo.com, and BitChute.com are some alternatives sites but they are small potatoes compared to youtube.

De-Google yourselves. The time is now.

Use Qwant/Duck Duck Go for search engines. They don't track users.

ProtonMail for email service. Encrypted email. No sniffing through your data to target you with adds. They make money by offering account tiers for more data and features. Basic accounts get 500 mb.

Alternatives to YouTube have been popping up with promise. BitChute is one I keep hearing is good, looks promising. ""Minds"" is another, crypto based social platform.

Obviously not, and the search quality isn't as good, but it's fast. What you can do is remove Google as your default search engine. Replace it with something else.

ALTERNATIVES TO GOOGLE PRODUCTS:
Google Search - DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Startpage
Google Chrome - Firefox and related browsers (i.e. Palemoon, SeaMonkey), Brave Browser, Comodo Dragon. Pic related is old but possibly useful to you, although I disagree with discounting browsers like Brave and Opera just because they look like they'll never become popular.
YouTube - Honestly this is probably the hardest to cut off for everyone, it's so ingrained into the internet at this point. Sharing videos via webm is an option. You can download YouTube videos into webm format using HookTube. For videos that are only on YouTube (unfortunately, a lot), you can search for and watch them on DuckDuckGo for better privacy protection via YouTube’s “youtube-nocookie” domain. In terms of serious alternatives: PeerTube, BitChute.
Google Maps - OpenStreetMap, MAPS.ME
Google Drive - DropBox, MEGA
Android - Ubuntu Touch, LineageOS, Sailfish OS, Plasma Mobile
Blogger - Ghost (paid unfortunately). I don't know a good alternative that isn't paid.

Co-chaired by Ardern and President Emmanuel Macron of France, the summit was intended to ""bring together countries and tech companies in an attempt to bring to an end the ability to use social media to organise and promote terrorism and violent extremism."" World leaders and technology companies pledged to ""eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online""; there were 17 signatories to the non-binding agreement. The pledge consists of three sections or commitments: one for governments, one for online service providers, and one for the ways in which the two can work together.

>Among the signatories to the pledge are the European Commission, and the governments of the following countries:
>Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom

>The following tech companies also signed the pledge:
>Amazon, Daily Motion, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Qwant, Twitter, YouTube
>The United States declined to attend, expressing concerns that US compliance with the agreement could create conflicts with free-speech protections in the country's Constitution.

On the context of freedom (the same used for the Protestant Revolution and the French Revolution), they pushed the idea that women needed to be ""free"" from the claws of men, using real, but sporadic examples of men doing shitty things, and not addressing the main reasons behind them (men who strayed from God).

They claim to be decentralised through torrents but what they do not mention is that all the torrents are hosted from their own servers, thus making it useless for decentralisation and even more useless as a ""cost-saving measure"" as they claim.

They are information brokers who capitalize on the low perceived value of information by the plebs. And oh boy have they capitalized. Let's hope it's not too late.

it is superior to adderall in every way. it is taken by the fighter pilots in the airforce when they go on missions

it is one of the most under discussed nootropics because it works and if people found out about it they might actually get the motivation and iq boost to change things. 

you think im joking? dont take my word for it. research that shit yourselves. dont use google. use duck duck go or qwant. there are mountains of data available on this. its the closest thing youll get to NZT

also, take boron. i guarantee that you lack it in your diet. not having boron in your diet is fucking up your hormones and contributing to weak hormones and fucked up skin. 

buy 20 mule team borax. its on amazon. its marketed as a detergent. ignore that shit - its to circumvent the food additive ban. Borax is used in cooking. has been used for hundreds of years. pharmajews got it banned because it counters the fluorosis of your pineal gland and bones. basically makes some pharma grade meds obsolete. 

anyways put like 1/4 tsp of borax into a liter of water and sip on in throughout the day. do it everyday for 3 months. your life will improve. keep doing it. make sure to also buy and take an electrolyte powder as well. theres a bunch on amazon or at the grocery store dont give yourself alkalosis.

","I'm really liking Qwant as a search engine. I find that Startpage and Duckduckgo will have a strong Leftist political bias, since they rely on Google. I think Qwant has their own algorithm, and I'm experiencing a lot less censorship.

Is there a good overview written on data tracking in general, so I get get a good conceptual grasp on the topic and understand all the ways in which big tech violates privacy?

>“Yellow fungus is generally found in reptiles. I found this for the first time in humans,” he told local news agency ANI
>Both black and white fungus infections are known as mucormycosis, caused by mucormycetes which live in the environment in rotting vegetables and fruit, bread, soils and plants.

I don't think there will be a return to dark ages, like the one after fall of Roman Empire. This would be a scenario if nothing changed a year ago and everything just continued it's course. But if things get shaken, we might have a chance to prevent this scenario and instead drive civilization forward. Read: Jews get what they fucking deserve. If we consider cycles again (this time not economic one, but social), if we are nearing the end of current cylce and a new one will begin, it might even be like that. We could even be positive and look forward into the future. After all, we are entering the Age of Aquarius (technological era), leaving the Age of Pisces behind (era of monotheism, pisces being the sign of Christ from). This later is another cycle, but this one lasting even way longer, 2k years or so.

I'll give you a personal observation considering forex. It has nothing to do with economics whatsoever, all the devaluating crap is meaningless, along with interest rates or other crap. It literally goes like this: forex = geopolitics. Nothing else.

I did not know this until I happened across a report by Teen Vogue where they talk all about how Nazis were bad for being against LBGTQ and for burning their books.

https://www.teenvogue.com/story/lgbtq-institute-in-germany-was-burned-down-by-nazis

HERE IS THE REALITY: The J**s were pushing the same lesbian/bi/trans/gay stuff in Germany, were running critical race theory in Germany, to destroy Germany, the same way they are in the United states now, AND THOSE ARE THE BOOKS HITLER BURNED. It for the most part stopped at that. And we would burn those same damn books if we could get our hands on them.

So Teen Vogue did a hit piece on conservatives, comparing them to Nazis, for wanting the same to happen here. Once I knew this was what the Nazis were really doing, and knew what to search, it all came right up on Qwant.

Obviously Teen Vogue totally skipped over how the books burned were produced by J**s, and backed by a foundation for sexual deviance that was set up by J**s because J**ish actions must be kept secret and their victim status must be maintained.

Here's an oddity I have yet to find an explanation for.
The horizontal lines on almost all of the ocean floors. 
My theory, is a bit mad, but possibly in the distant past the ocean floor was dry land, and intensively mined for it's wealth of resources by an ancient civilisation erased from the records deliberately.

and lets remember that this is the /thinking/ people... people whos intellectual capacity is at the level of navigating based on /sense/... most people are not /thinking/ people. that is to say, they may use thinking here and there but for the big issues they rely on their /feelings/.

right now those feelings are caught up with the TV-images of ice-trucks of corpses, ice-rink ""graveyards"" and intelligence op's showing horror scenarious in hospitals. and nothing of logic can change the perception they have of this being a serious pandemic because it conflicts with those TV-images unless you somehow can shed doubt about those events being real.

If you can manage that you have to deal with redditisms like ""all scientists agree""(source: persons ass) blahblahblah.

Truth is for all thinking people this so-called pandemic has more red flags than a communist parade, so many plot holes its now at c movie level, so many suspicious things its not even funny. but those who are caught in the system conveniently forgets those things or rationalize them to fit into their preexisting worldview. most of them never hear about most of the problems because the news dont focus on it and they have no great experience with investigating things themselves or simply dont have time or care.",NA,NA,FALSE,NA

I've written extensive as well as extremely short feedback about single points, multiple times, on all named addresses with experience, explanation, reasons, ideas. Not a single one of these fuckers ever bothered to answer, and I've done that for YEARS with various e-mail addresses. That feedback goes right into the shredder, that much is for sure. It was so super frustrating watching things get worse and worse over the years. The censorship is the least of the issues. We're drowned in mediocre garbage and the search engines support that. Even if there was the holy grail out there, the solution to everything, the search engines wouldn't let us find it but come with their shit tier features, like page ranking, resulting in always getting results for the same (((popular))) pages and terms, not allowing a new site with quality content to be listed within the first ten pages unless it's some globohomo corporation or some pushed fag. Being forced to use garbage tier ""search engines"" (even the name is wrong: they don't actually search but censor, filter, use misdirecting terms instead of my provided search terms) is the only thing that gets me boiling mad with rage these days and it's a huge irresponsibility forcing billions of users daily into the same experience: not being able to look something up. Try finding sources matching Bitmap Brothers game ""Z"", for example, or the dos game ""M.A.X."" without naming anything but their actual title - so muuuch garbage just because a category filter ""game"" / ""video"" / ""review"" / ""technical issue (software)"" doesn't exist to filter out all the SHIT.",DE,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1637211267432.jpg
