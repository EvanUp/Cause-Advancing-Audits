","***************** How to improve OpSec physically (Computer Systems, Security and Networks) *****************

Ok so while I won't explain each of these methods in detail, I'll list the method of protection along with what it does:

A Network Level VPN (Router Level) - Runs all network traffic through a VPN meaning that you can't be identified by IP address, important against being identified by the Police more than anything. (Socks5 Aswell as this is good)
>nordVPN and proton are pozed. Same CEO for both companies and somehting about payments going to Luthiania
>take the sentinel pill, blockchain based vpn
http://www.sentinel.co

If you got spare pc or laptop. Isolate your shitposting ""computer or connection"" from your main computer - Nothing done on one computer can be linked to anything done on the other computer.

Secure your computer systems use custom firewalls and Security solutions to ensure that the regular malware infested tools that you'll find won't work.

Use FDE or Full Disk Encryption - to stop forensic teams from being able to inspect your computers and link activities to you.

Harden your chosen operating system settings and security - (You'll have to (((google))) or Quant/swisscows.ch/Yandex(if you're fine with FSB) how to harden your specific operating system). STOP USING Mac and Windows or any Google products. 
>take the Linux pill
>alt mobile os like Ubuntu touch and LineageOS

Use a proxy within the browser - always (this is to give the impression of you being an average user and to make sure that even if the VPN fails you can't log into any shady sites without some level of protection.

Harden your browser - to reduce the attack vectors that hackers, skids and law enforcement would use to identify you.

1.1 Change default search engine to Yandex or https://swisscows.ch/ as suggested by Bong bro on other thread. I personally prefer Yandex because it is out of US and NSA spying and basically better than google. 
2. Learn how to change dns on your router. That's right! Not on your OS or your browser, but on your router. I will not spoonfeed you but I will give you this link - https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html 
3. You can choose to use adguard's DNS, which blocks ads by default and is also Russian or you can choose to use other encrypted DNS servers. Here are some of the lists - https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/ -- https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/ -- Or you can use nextdns.io to configure the filters yourself. It is basically free but the owners are jews. So think for yourself. 
4. Change your DNS on your OS. Yeah, I liked, you need to do this just to be sure. Windows, mac, android etc have their different methods to do it so use your favorite search engine to learn how to.
4.4 After fixing your dns check if it's leaking your ISP's dns by going here https://www.dnsleaktest.com/

The only good suggestion so far and it's from shitposter central.Searx is absolutely legit. Open source and doesn't store ANYTHING. My only qualms about it is that since OP is clearly a tech illiterate zoomer/boomer he is gonna end up getting google results(mainly) without google tracking. Sure you can download the searx code from git and throw some plug n play search features on top of it but i wouldn't suggest that unless you can further modify the code.(if you dont, you are basically decoupling yourself from the rest of the people and their searches and make you and your IP stand out like a sore thumb)
A better option for someone that is a tech retard would be Startpage and/or Swisscows.So to sum it up; Searx if you know wtf you are doing, Startpage/Swisscows if you are a normie.",GR,NA,FALSE,https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1479525005117.png

1. Download microsoft edge - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge Yeah, you might think I'm memeing but I am not. Brave shills get the rope.
1.1 Change default search engine to Yandex or https://swisscows.ch/ as suggested by Bong bro on other thread. I personally prefer Yandex because it is out of US and NSA spying and basically better than google. 
2. Learn how to change dns on your router. That's right! Not on your OS or your browser, but on your router. I will not spoonfeed you but I will give you this link - https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html 
3. You can choose to use adguard's DNS, which blocks ads by default and is also Russian or you can choose to use other encrypted DNS servers. Here are some of the lists - https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/ -- https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/ -- Or you can use nextdns.io to configure the filters yourself. It is basically free but the owners are jews. So think for yourself. 
4. Change your DNS on your OS. Yeah, I liked, you need to do this just to be sure. Windows, mac, android etc have their different methods to do it so use your favorite search engine to learn how to.
4.4 After fixing your dns check if it's leaking your ISP's dns by going here https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ 
Here are some extra features: 
5. install violentmonkey extension 
6. install 4chanx

Don't ever quiet down. Going with the flow lets them win. At least put up a fight, and your peers just might join you.

Work out, and become as alpha as possible. Women are retards and will ignore political views if you're attractive and powerful.

Stop using any product that supports the enemy--difficult because they own nearly anything but do your best.

Replace Google with DuckDuckGo, Gibiru, SearX, SwissCows. Change your default search engine now.

Replace YouTube with Bitchute, Utreon, Vimeo

Replace Chrome with Firefox

Don't use Facebook, Twitter, YouTube ever again. If you must use YouTube, only support content providers that are on our side, and don't pay for YouTube service. Block their ads if possible.

Replace Gmail with ProtonMail, GMX

Utilize torrenting and Popcorn Time to avoid compensating them for their propaganda

Don't even give an impression to any video or article by CNN, NYT, Washington Post or any of the ""mainstream"" outlets. Use NewsMax, NTD where necessary, or just do your own fucking research.

If you hit them in their wallets--that's how you hurt them. If you make them just a little bit less popular, just a little bit less rich, you win at least a little. 

Support the Chans, Mastodon, Gab, MeWe, Rumble, or any other social media platform that supports free speech.

Not a single one of these fuckers ever bothered to answer, and I've done that for YEARS with various e-mail addresses. That feedback goes right into the shredder, that much is for sure. It was so super frustrating watching things get worse and worse over the years. The censorship is the least of the issues. We're drowned in mediocre garbage and the search engines support that. Even if there was the holy grail out there, the solution to everything, the search engines wouldn't let us find it but come with their shit tier features, like page ranking, resulting in always getting results for the same (((popular))) pages and terms, not allowing a new site with quality content to be listed within the first ten pages unless it's some globohomo corporation or some pushed fag. Being forced to use garbage tier ""search engines"" (even the name is wrong: they don't actually search but censor, filter, use misdirecting terms instead of my provided search terms) is the only thing that gets me boiling mad with rage these days and it's a huge irresponsibility forcing billions of users daily into the same experience: not being able to look something up.
