","Yeah. 

I remember you linking that in a previous thread. I will check it out. 

The thing that worries me is that more recently, the frequency of the synchronicities has increased. 

For example, earlier in the thread I posted an image containing posts with a bunch of gibberish. These posts can be decoded via Rotate X (usually x = 7 or 8) cyphers. Most of them are references to Marion Pettie and the Finders. 

However, one of them was different. The post containing the image of Behold a Pale Horse has gibberish for text. I couldn't deciper, so I put it into google. Nothing. I tried putting it into Ecosia, and received a lone result. What I found in on that page horrified me.",US,NA,FALSE,NA

","So let me get this straight. 

Somebody decided to post a bunch of gibberish, accompanied alongside images you very frequently use in your LARP threads. 

They then decided to delete the gibberish from a single one of those posts. Coincidentally, when searched on Ecosia, the sole search result for that very gibberish (the stuff that was deleted), turns up a group centered around sharing child porn. 

Does that sound about right?",US,NA,FALSE,NA

The scene above the bed is the story of Mary and Jesus in Christian-Japanese style. It shows the Resurrection, not the death of Jesus. That is John the Baptist's head on the ladder. The ""strange man"" with Gloria was her husband, Leo Stokowski, the father of the baby in the picture. Djurdjuvec's art is disturbing and anybody who likes it that much has got to be sick. The children are in tiled rooms, not the swimming pool. The room is tiled, hinting that the room is meant for killing, I am not sure. Too many holes in this article. I don't find Gloria's art as disturbing. These might just be her nightmares from a very painful life.

It’s quite impossible to be completely anonymous in the Internet. But there are some tricks to make it harder to track you tho
Use Linux Tails for an easy start, if you surf from your own computer, use Tor Browser 
If possible use public computers, in every library are computers 
Don’t use services where you have to log in and verify and avoid all google services (at least at home)
Regarding amazon, you could just avid online shopping. If you live in a larger German city you’ll get everything you need, and most shops even order stuff if you ask
If you still wanna order stuff, the deutsche Post has Packing stations (with deutsche Post Account) or Postfächer (you get a number and it gets delivered to this). I don’t know if postfächer are still available anonymous but there were once

It’ll be never possible to be online AND be completely anonymously, e.g. google can track you by your typing characteristics on any computer

Your little boycott means shit. Nobody cares. The oh-so-evil companies you choose to boycott provide superior goods and services. Them platforming your little political crackpot ideology deprives us of FAR less value than their goods and services provide.

We can deal without you and your political views. By ""we"", I LITERALLY mean ""everybody but you Drumpftards"".

You are isolated.
You are alone.
You will be forgotten.
Nobody cares.

The deplatforming will continue.

Everyone will be fine with it.
Nobody will know you ever existed.

>Innumerable moons ago, a race of white men, 10 feet high, and far more rich and powerful than any white people now living, here inhabited a large range of country, extending from the rising to the setting sun. Their fortifications crowned the summits of the mountains, protecting their populous cities situated in the intervening valleys.

>They excelled every other nation which was flourished, either before or since, in all manner of cunning handicraft—were brave and warlike—ruling over the land they had wrested from its ancient possessors with a high and haughty hand.

>The giants found in Anderson were not as large as the largest ones found in Peru and France, measuring 36 feet tall and 25 feet tall, respectively; but they were considerably taller than the tallest men at that time, at least seven to nine feet tall. The thousands of giant skeletons found throughout the world have measured from seven to 36 feet tall. Some have six fingers and toes and a double row of teeth and a few have been found with horn-like protuberances on their foreheads.

>Never included in history books is the fact that every Native American tribe in America tells the same tale of having to fight and kill the giants because they were man eaters and were decimating the native tribes. Perhaps because the giants were so large, the tribes mounded dirt to bury them instead of digging graves, which would explain the hundreds, if not thousands of mound burial sites throughout the mid west and other parts of the country. Giant skeletal remains have also been found from Brooklyn, NY to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. Most of the remains are mass burials with signs of violent death, as if a huge battle had been fought, won and the massacred buried as efficiently as possible.

>The Nephilim Chronicles: Fallen Angels in the Ohio Valley website reports in an article in the Lima Daily News, July 27, 1892, that Congress was considering buying the Anderson mounds for a national park, as the mounds were considered exceptional in that day.. Not only were the skulls found here very large, but they all contained a fifth skull bone. The giant skeletons in the dried air mound were found sitting and as the fresh air entered the tomb, their bones disintegrated to powder. Scientific study placed the existence of these beings to the time of the Egyptian Pharaohs.

","Wrong. Assad never attacked his own people.

The first ""chemical attack"" was the result of a Russian fighter jet firing a missile into a storage warehouse that, according to their intel, only held weapons and ammo. Unknown to them, the Syrian al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra was storing chemical weapons there. That's what fucked people up. Zerohedge was the only site that carried the story as they had a CIA contact who knew the boots-on-the-ground agents there and wanted to get the truth out.

After the 2018 ""attack"" OANN's Pearson Sharp went to Douma where the locals told him no attack ever took place. And..

>British journalist Robert Fisk has reported in The Independent that he visited a subterranean clinic in the former rebel stronghold of eastern Ghouta, where he spoke to senior medic, Dr. Assim Rahaibani.

>Rahaibani told the veteran reporter that children seen with breathing apparatus and doused in water in a video used to back up claims that chemical weapons were used against them were in fact suffering from oxygen deprivation from being inside tunnels and confined underground spaces while hiding from fighting going on in the city.

>Rahaibani said: “People began to arrive here suffering from hypoxia, oxygen loss. Then someone at the door, a ‘White Helmet’, shouted ‘Gas!’ and a panic began. People started throwing water over each other. Yes, the video was filmed here, it is genuine, but what you see are people suffering from hypoxia — not gas poisoning.”
