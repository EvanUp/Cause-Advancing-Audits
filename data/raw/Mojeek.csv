I was looking into this theory for a while but I realized I was wrong.

Kikes have thousand of years experience in sniffing out the intricate secrets of their host. Sometimes masquerading as white. Sometimes as arabs. (Never as blacks afaik but those can be bought.)

So it came as no surprise when the biggest Search Engine analyser [www.searchenginewatch.com] was revealed to me as a Kike puppet, that spends a lot of hours to make sure there is no technology within the Search market they have missed.

If it's on the Internet, they know about it, but having tentacles and periscopes inside enemy territory is useful to see what they're up to.
No need to shut down everything. Just that which gets normies attention and cause them to ask questions.

Good post and JPG. So added to it for my personal use.
The problem with Right-wingers is that they fight fair. They argue knowledge and logic because they know it's right (no pun intended), instead of attacking friends and family from behind.
But the backstab beats the jab.

","i'm just generally angry these days and there are so many bots and jdf kikes on here that it is relentless.
searches have been almost completely ruined in the last 5-10 years, it is deliberate. it just comes out with the same controlled top ten sites.
you have to eliminate keywords and go for only factual sites.
my search was by not including anything to do with the 'vaccine' or 'covid', and only searching for ""mRNA gene therapy"", because that is the name of the technology.
then you have to ignore all the recent propaganda and disinfo, so you can add ""-vaccine"" if necessary.
advanced searches can include dates, so only information older than january, 2020 are included.
if you want more varied results, i recommend using
https://searx.info - or one of the other 'searx' search engine mirrors.
on that, go to preferences at the top, and then 'engines', and eliminate google/wikipedia etc etc, and include some of the less mainstream search engines.
'mojeek' is a supposedly truly independent search engine, but it has limited results due to the database not being very large yet.
it is perhaps the only completely independent search engine that i have found in several years of searching.

","compare google or other search engines - if any exist from 2001 to now.
even from 2010 to now.
they are useless, deliberately broken and noticeably worse every six months.
10 years ago and for 15 years before that, you could search for ""old man helps kid time travel skateboard"" and it would come out with the name of the film/series/episode/game/cartoon. try it now and it puts up a list of amazing links to buy skateboards, or half a dozen articles about how skateboarding is racist.
this is all intentional, search engines are crippled, and if you can't find the information, it might as well not exist.
note also that there are almost ZERO alternatives to google/bing/yahoo. everything else is just using those as its basis. just a few years ago, bing still gave different results, now they are almost identical to google, and just as useless.
everything has been passed through an extremely narrow funnel, so everyone is experiencing the same experiences, finding the same results, and thinking the same thoughts - it is to create a cattle mindstate.
the only real alternative, so they claim, that i have found, is mojeek, which says it was built from the ground up, and remains separate. results are fewer, but it is slightly more accurate.
then there is searx, a meta search where you can select which engines are used in the preferences. eliminating google etc, and even duckduckgo from it helps somewhat.

this, combined with everything else that has been happening and is happening now especially, is turning humanity into battery chicken farms. living the bare minimum of an identical life to satisfy the basic, reconstructed needs, the smallest living space possible, and the blandest, cheapest feed possible.

Lets test search results with one controversial website which is blacklisted almost everywhere on the internet. I am talking about the old forum which goes under the name stormfront. Here if you search for that word you ain't gonna be able to have a direct link to that ""controversial"" forum.

","spent a lot of years monitoring this.
in 2000, there were tons of separate search engines. in the late 90s, search engines had become less accurate and more corrupted by adverts and paid results, google arrived with a clean, plain format, no paid results.
once it eliminated the competition, it became more and more paid and less accurate.
about 15 years ago, google results started becoming less accurate, more interpretive. more was censored/directed.
10 years ago it was already heavily filtered, babified. searching for anything real delivered only restricted results.
8 years ago it spread to bing, with the same results more or less appearing on both.
i spent several years every now and again looking for real alternatives and found none. they were all based on yaboo/bing/google. eventually I found a version of searx that had been rebranded, then managed to find the real searx.
it was meta search, but you could choose which engines were being used, and eliminate the main - poisoned ones.
a while after that I found mojeek, which claims to be independent, designed from scratch, and the results are actually different. results however are low in number and it doesn't cover a lot of old stuff.
a lot of this filtering/diverting/censorship killed all the independent sites and forums. old visitors and user numbers dropped off, and since no one could find even heavily established sites, there were no new visitors, so they were shut down by their often one man teams.
i went to a site I'd first used 20 years before to find the guy who'd made and run it all that time saying he was closing it since his site wasn't searchable and no one was coming.
it was a really useful site and none have replaced it.

DuckDuckGo is suggested a lot as an alternative to Google but it sucks just as bad as Google. Same lame search results.

I really want to spread the word about this website. So many of the search engines he shows that have their own search indexes are SOOO much better than Google for finding good information that's no so heavily propagandized by the mainstream media.

Finding alternatives to YouTube was easier than for Google. BitChute is great for the stuff that YouTube likes to delete these days. Conspiracy videos for the most part, which is what I loved about YouTube anyways. If I'm looking for a more ""mainstream"" feel, I go to Odysee.com or even Rumble.com. But I feel that Odysee and Bitchute by themselves are good enough to replace Youtube for me personally.

","i noticed over a decade ago that search engines were being blinkered. i spent years looking for alternatives, with the main ones becoming more and more similar over time.
i found there were no real alternatives to bing/gugal/yahu - everything was just a reskin, and all three produced almost identical results, with bing being the last holdout for a while until it fell in line too.
the internet might exist, but there's no way to find it. it's just the same top 10-20 sites in almost every search, and search terms aren't even searched for - it just interprets what you might be searching for from their pre-made catalogue of forced 'choices', and delivers one of those.
with no search engine, you can't really find any alternative to anything, even if it exists. there's no wide open space now, just corridors they choose for you.
one i found which was semi useful was searx, a meta search where you can turn off engines - i.e. the big ones that give false results, but it isn't up to much.
then the last one which seems to have been made from the ground up is a small one called mojeek - but it gives very few results and is clearly incomplete. it does however pass the tests i set and spent years using.",ES,NA,FALSE,NA
