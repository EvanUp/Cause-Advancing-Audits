 Fully independent search engine as it has its own web crawler and index. Doesn't rely on indexes from Big Tech. Gives unbiased results and strives to protect user privacy but it is based in the UK which is a five eyes country. Uses 100% green servers if that is your thing. Only downside is that the results can be sometimes be weak at times.

>Wiby
https://wiby.me/
Independent search engine primarily dedicated to old-school websites, and you can submit URLs. No big tech allowed. Doesn't need JavaScript.

>Searx
https://searx.me/
This is an open source metasearch engine that aggregates results from search engines of your choosing. You can either choose from a public instance, or self-host your own

>YaCy
https://yacy.net/
Open source, self-hosted, distributed search engine written in Java. Based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Completely decentralized and amazing when it comes to privacy. Has lots of features.

When Pluto is Dominant, the native will be extremely passionate and implacable, although on the outside he will show a cold or calm image. He will be reserved or even lonely, and will be hopelessly attracted to everything that society fears and considers bad or forbidden.

 He rules over rebels and revolutionaries capable of resorting to the most radical and violent methods. He provides a great ambition for power and a desire to dominate or control his fellow man. It is ideal for all professions that involve taking great risks: military, police and firefighters, but also psychologists and psychiatrists, forensic scientists, occultists and magicians. Likewise, Plutonians can perform professions related to sex or be criminals and outlaws.

Decentralization seems like it would be the way to go, that and hearing real human voices. Not text only, actual voice communication...and private invites to communities (sorta like the spheel kiwifarms had set up...but even kiwi farms had the seal of solomon at the very bottom of the page, the names ""null"" and ""moon"" are also occult references). This won't get rid of shills, as they're paid humans purposely being an ass, but it will at least get rid of annoying bots.

Forums are great because you get to know people over time, bots can only seem human or real when the reply is a short one, typically on forums replies are 3 or 4 paragraphs long...all contextually relevant, all with nuance (no talking in generalizations but with specifics), with human personality, and with a sense of understanding of the human condition (cynicism, describing internal thought processes etc)
