We knew how to stand up to each other. We knew how to read each other. The world was honest... as much as human nature can permit honesty. But even then, when we were being lied to, we knew. We could read each other and see through the deception.

","Yes, pretty much this.
There are good videos so long as the subject isnt political. But with that said, you can't use YouTube's in-house search engine without getting a bunch of bullshit prioritized mainstream and pozzed content In your search results.

Use something like DuckDuckGo to search for the video you want
""Better form archery""
Then you get your search results, click ""Videos"" and scroll through the listings indexed by the search engine, not YouTube itself.

Now because bitchute has caved to pressure from the ADL, certain search terms have been hidden when you use the in-house search engine (same for jewtube of course).
> How git a'round dis?

Easy.
Use duckduckgo, type the follow in the search bar to use a metacrawler to find the content within a specific video hosting site that might be pozzed:
> site:bitchute.com Hitler was Right

Just an example above.
Now if you want to find specific terms, like the specific video titled ""Hitler was Right, use quotation marks in the field, thus:
> site:bitchute.com ""Hitler was Right""

Cool, eh?
This is how I find a ton of great videos that still remain on you tube yet are not indexed through the in-house search engine, which would otherwise pull up gay ass, inorganic (((promoted content))) that likely has three or four interruptions by advertisements which only depict black people and *only* show Whites when they are either inferior or subordinate to blacks.

So, lessons learned:
> Do not use the in house search functions for jewtube or any of these sites.
> Use something that isnt chrome or safari (I like Brave and Vivaldi :D
> Dont use google to search
> Use Duckduckgo or something similar which doesn't rely on Google for indexing results.
> Search the topic you want
> Click ""Videos""
> Voila!
